<h2>"GOD FOR US"</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Romans VIII. 31.</span>)</h3>


<p>How much is wrapped up in these few words,
"God for us!" They form one of those
marvelous chains of three links so frequently found
in Scripture. We have "God" linked on to "us"
by that precious little word "for." This secures
every thing, for time and eternity. There is not a
single thing within the entire range of a creature's
necessities that are not included in the brief but
comprehensive sentence which forms the heading of
this paper. If God be for us, then it follows, of necessity&mdash;blessed
necessity&mdash;that neither our sins, nor
our iniquities, nor our guilt, nor our ruined nature,
nor Satan, nor the world, nor any other creature
can possibly stand in the way of our present peace
and our everlasting felicity and glory. God can
dispose of all&mdash;has disposed of them, in such a way
as to illustrate His own glory, and magnify His
holy name, throughout the wide universe, forever and
ever. All praise and adoration be to the eternal
Trinity!</p>

<p>It may be, however, that the reader feels disposed,
at the very outset, to inquire how he is to know his
place amongst the "us" of our precious thesis.
This, truly, is a most momentous question. Our
eternal weal or woe hangs upon the answer. How,
then, are we to know that God is for us? In reply
to this most weighty question, we shall seek, by
God's grace, to furnish the reader with five substantial
proofs that God is for us, in all our need,
our guilt, our misery, and our danger&mdash;for us, spite
of all that we are, and all that we have done&mdash;for us,
although there is no reason whatever, so far as we
are concerned, why He should be for us, but every
reason why He should be against us.</p>

<p>The first grand proof which we shall adduce is&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">THE GIFT OF HIS SON.</p>

<p>"For God so loved the world, that He gave His
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him
should not perish, but have everlasting life."
(John iii. 16.)</p>

<p>Now, we are glad, for various reasons, to commence
our series of proofs with these memorable
words. In the first place, they meet a difficulty
which may suggest itself to the mind of an anxious
reader&mdash;a difficulty based upon the fact that the
sentence culled from Rom. viii. 31 evidently applies
primarily to believers, and only to such, as does the
entire epistle and every one of the epistles.</p>

<p>But, blessed be God, no such difficulty can be
started in reference to the all-embracing, and encouraging
words of Him who spake as never man
spake. When we have from the lips of our blessed
Lord Himself, the eternal Son of God, such words
as these, "God so loved <i>the world</i>," we have no
ground whatever for questioning their application
to each and all who come under the comprehensive
word "world." Before any one can prove that the
free love of God does not apply to him, he must first
prove that he does not form a part of the world, but
that he belongs to some other sphere of being. If
indeed, our Lord had said, "God so loved a certain
portion of the world," call it what you please, then
verily it would be absolutely necessary to prove that
we belong to that particular portion or class, ere we
could attempt to apply His words to ourselves. If
He had said that God so loved the predestinated,
the elect, or the called, then we must seek to know
our place amongst the number of such, before we
can take home to ourselves the precious assurance
of the love of God, as proved by the gift of His Son.</p>

<p>But our Lord used no such qualifying clause. He
is addressing one who, from his earliest days, had
been trained and accustomed to take a very limited
view indeed of the favor and goodness of God.
Nicodemus had been taught to consider that the
rich tide of Jehovah's goodness, loving-kindness,
and tender mercy could only flow within the narrow
inclosure of the Jewish system and the Jewish nation.
The thought of its rolling forth to the wide
wide world had never, we may safely assert, penetrated
the mind of one trained amid the contracting
influences of the legal system. Hence, therefore, it
must have sounded passing strange in his ear, to
hear "a teacher come from God" giving utterance
to the great fact that God loved not merely the Jewish
nation, nor yet some special portion of the
human race, but "the world." No doubt, such a
statement would add not a little to the amazement
felt by this master in Israel at being told that he
himself, with all His religious advantages, needed
to be born again in order to see or enter the kingdom
of God.</p>

<p>Do we then deny or call in question the grand
truth of predestination, election, or effectual calling?
God forbid. We hold these things as amongst the
fundamental principles of true Christianity. We
believe in the eternal counsels and purposes of our
God&mdash;His unsearchable decrees&mdash;His electing love&mdash;His
sovereign mercy.</p>

<p>But do any or all of these things interfere, in the
smallest degree, with the gracious activities of the
divine nature, or the outgoings of God's love towards
a lost world? In no wise. God is love.
That is His blessed nature, and this nature must
express itself toward all. The mistake lies in supposing
that because God has His purposes, His
counsels, His decrees&mdash;because He is sovereign in
His grace and mercy&mdash;because He has chosen from
all eternity a people for His own praise and glory&mdash;because
the names of the redeemed, all the redeemed,
were written down in the book of the slain
Lamb, before the foundation of the world&mdash;that
therefore God cannot be said to love all mankind&mdash;to
love the world&mdash;and, moreover that the glad tidings
of God's full and free salvation ought not to
be proclaimed in the ears of every creature under
heaven.</p>

<p>The simple fact is that the two lines, though so
perfectly distinct, are laid down with equal clearness,
in the word of God; neither interferes, in the smallest
degree, with the other, but both together go to
make up the beauteous harmony of divine truth and
to set forth the glorious unity of the divine nature.</p>

<p>Now, it is with the activities of the divine nature
and the outgoings of divine love that the preacher
of the gospel has specially to do. He is not to be
cramped, crippled, or confined in his blessed work,
by any reference to God's secret decrees or purposes,
though fully aware of the existence of such.
His mission is to the world&mdash;the wide wide world.
His theme is salvation&mdash;a salvation as full as the
heart of God, as permanent as the throne of God&mdash;as
free as the air&mdash;free to all without any exception,
limitation, or condition whatsoever. The basis of
his work is the atoning death of Christ which has
removed all barriers out of the way, and opened up
the floodgates in order that the mighty tide of divine
love may roll forth, in all its fulness, richness and
blessedness, to a lost and guilty world.</p>

<p>And here, we may add, lies the ground of man's
responsibility in reference to the gospel of God. If,
indeed, it be true that God so loved the world as to
give His only begotten Son&mdash;if "the righteousness
of God is unto all" (Rom. iii. 22)&mdash;if it be God's gracious
will that "all should be saved and come to
the knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. ii. 4)&mdash;if He is
"not willing that any should perish but that all
should come to repentance" (2 Pet. iii. 9)&mdash;then
verily is every man who hears this glorious gospel
laid under the most solemn responsibility to believe
it and be saved. No one can honestly and truthfully
turn round and say, "I longed to be saved,
but could not, because I was not one of the elect.
I longed to flee from the wrath to come but was
prevented by the insuperable barrier of the divine
decree which irresistibly consigned me to an everlasting
hell."</p>

<p>There is not, within the covers of the volume of
God, in the entire range of His dealings with His
creatures, in the aspect of His character, or in the
enactments of His moral government, the very
faintest shadow of a foundation for such an objection.
Every man is left without excuse. God can
say to all who have rejected His gospel, "I would,
but ye would not." There is absolutely no such
thing as reprobation in the word of God, meaning
thereby the consignment on God's part, of any number
of His creatures to everlasting damnation.
Everlasting fire is prepared for the devil and his
angels. (Matt. xxv.) Men <i>will</i> rush into it. "Vessels
of wrath" are fitted, not by God, but by themselves,
"to destruction." (Rom. ix.) Everyone who
gets to heaven will have to thank God for it. Everyone
who finds himself in hell will have to blame
himself for it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have ever to remember that the
sinner has nothing to do with God's unpublished
decrees. What does he&mdash;what can he&mdash;know about
such? Nothing whatever. But he has to do with
God's published love&mdash;His proffered mercy&mdash;His
free salvation&mdash;His glorious gospel. We may fearlessly
assert that so long as these glowing and glorious
words shine in the record of God, "<i>Whosoever
will</i> let him take of the water of life <i>freely</i>," (Rev.
xxii. 17) it is impossible for any son or daughter of
Adam to say, "I longed to be saved, but could not.
I thirsted for the living water, but could not reach
it. The well was deep and I had nothing to draw
with." Ah, no! such language will never be used,
such an objection will never be urged by anyone in
all the ranks of the lost. When men pass into eternity
they will see with awful clearness what they
now affect to think is so obscure and perplexing,
namely, the perfect compatibility of God's electing
sovereign grace and the free offer of salvation to all&mdash;the
fullest harmony between divine sovereignty
and human responsibility.</p>

<p>We fondly trust the reader sees these things, even
now. It is of the very last possible importance to
maintain the balance of truth in the soul&mdash;to allow
the beams of divine revelation to act, with full
power, on the heart and conscience, unimpeded by
the murky atmosphere of mere human theology.
There is imminent danger in taking up a certain
number of abstract truths and forming them into a
system. We want the adjusting power of <i>all truth</i>.
The growth and practical sanctification of the soul
are promoted, not by some truth, but by <i>the</i> truth,
in all its fullness, as embodied in the person of
Christ, and set forth by the eternal Spirit in the holy
scriptures. We must get rid completely of all our
own preconceived notions&mdash;all merely theological
views and opinions&mdash;and come like a little child, to
the feet of Jesus to be taught by His Spirit, from
out His holy word. Thus only shall we find rest
from conflicting dogmas. Thus shall all the heavy
clouds and mists of human opinion be rolled away,
and our enfranchised souls shall bask in the clear
sunlight of a full divine revelation.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed with our proofs.</p>

<p>The second fact which we shall adduce to prove
that God is for us will be found in</p>

<p class="center">THE DEATH OF HIS SON.</p>

<p>And, for our present purpose, it is only necessary
for us to take up one feature in the atoning death
of Christ, but that one feature is a cardinal one.
We refer to the marvellous fact set forth by the Holy
Ghost in the prophet Isaiah, "It pleased Jehovah
to bruise Him. He hath put Him to grief." (Chapter
liii.)</p>

<p>Our blessed Lord might have come into this world
of sin and sorrow. He might have become a man.
He might have been baptized in the Jordan&mdash;anointed
by the Holy Ghost&mdash;tempted of Satan in
the wilderness. He might have gone about doing
good. He might have lived and labored, wept and
prayed, and, at the close, gone back to heaven
again, thus leaving us involved in deeper gloom than
ever. He might, like the priest or the Levite, in the
parable, have come and looked upon us in our
wounds and misery, passed by on the other side
and returned alone to the place from whence He
came.</p>

<p>And what if He had? what, reader, but the flames
of an everlasting hell for thee and me? For, be it
well remembered, that all the living labors of the
Son of God&mdash;His amazing ministry&mdash;His days of
toil and His nights of prayer&mdash;His tears, His sighs,
His groans&mdash;the whole of His life-work, from the
manger up to, but short of, the cross, could not
have blotted out one speck of guilt from a human
conscience. "Without shedding of blood is no remission."
No doubt, the eternal Son had to become
a man that He might die; but incarnation
could not cancel guilt. Indeed, the life of Christ,
as a man on this earth, only proved the human race
more guilty still. "If I had not come and spoken
to them, they had not had sin." The light that
shone in His blessed ways only revealed the moral
darkness of man&mdash;of Israel&mdash;of the world. Hence,
therefore, had He merely come and lived and labored
here for three-and-thirty years, and gone back to
heaven, our guilt and moral darkness would have
been fully proved but no atonement made. "It
is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul."
"Without shedding of blood is no remission," (Heb.
ix. 22.)</p>

<p>This is a grand foundation-truth of Christianity,
and must be constantly affirmed, and tenaciously
held. There is immense moral power in it. If it
be true that all the life-labors of the Son of God&mdash;His
tears, His prayers, His groans, His sighs&mdash;if all
these things put together could not cancel one
single speck of guilt; then, indeed, may we not lawfully
inquire what possible value can there be in
our works&mdash;our tears&mdash;our prayers&mdash;our religious
services&mdash;our ordinances, sacraments and ceremonies&mdash;the
whole range of religious activity and moral
reform? Can such things avail to cancel our
sins and give us a righteousness before God? The
thought is perfectly monstrous. If any or all of
these things could avail, then why the sacrificial,
atoning death of Christ? Why that ineffable and
inestimable sacrifice, if aught else would have done?</p>

<p>But, it will perhaps be said that, although none
of these things could avail <i>without</i> the death of
Christ, yet they must be added to it. For what?
To make that peerless death&mdash;that precious blood&mdash;that
priceless sacrifice of full avail? Is that it?
Shall the rubbish of human doings, human righteousness,
be flung into the scale to make the sacrifice
of Christ of full avail in the judgment of God?
The bare thought is positive and absolute blasphemy.</p>

<p>But are there not to be good works? Yes, verily;
but what are they? Are they the pious doings, the
religious efforts, the moral activities of unregenerate,
unconverted, unbelieving nature? Nay. What then?
What are the Christian's good works? They are
<i>life-works</i>, not dead works. They are the precious
fruits of life possessed&mdash;the life of Christ in the true
believer. There is not anything beneath the canopy
of heaven which God can accept as a good work
save the fruit of the grace of Christ in the believer.
The very feeblest expression of the life of Christ, in
the daily history of a Christian, is fragrant and precious
to God. But the most splendid and gigantic
labors of an unbeliever are, in God's account, but
"dead works."</p>

<p>All this, however, is a digression from our main
line, to which we must now return.</p>

<p>We have said that, for our present purpose, we
shall merely refer to one special point in the death
of Christ, and that is the fact that it pleased Jehovah
to bruise Him. Herein lies the striking and soul-subduing
proof that God is for us. "He spared
not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all."
He not merely <i>gave</i> Him but <i>bruised</i> Him, and that
for us. That spotless, holy, perfect One&mdash;the only
perfect Man that ever trod this earth&mdash;the One who
ever did the things which pleased His Father&mdash;whose
whole life from the manger to the tree was one continued
sweet odor ascending to the throne and to
the heart of God&mdash;whose every movement, every
word, every look, every thought was well-pleasing
to God&mdash;whose one grand object, from first to last,
was to glorify God and finish His work&mdash;this blessed
One was delivered by the determinate counsel and
foreknowledge of God&mdash;was nailed to the cursed
tree, and there endured the righteous wrath of a
sin-hating God; and all this because God was for
us&mdash;even <i>us</i>.</p>

<p>What marvellous and matchless grace is here!
The Just One bruised for the unjust&mdash;the sinless,
spotless, holy Jesus, bruised by the hand of Infinite
Justice in order that guilty rebels might be saved;
and not only saved but brought into the position
and relationship of sons&mdash;sons and daughters of the
Lord Almighty&mdash;heirs of God and joint-heirs with
Christ.</p>

<p>This surely is grace&mdash;rich, free, sovereign grace&mdash;grace
abounding to the very chief of sinners&mdash;grace
reigning, through righteousness, unto eternal
life, by Jesus Christ. Who would not trust this
grace? Who can look at the cross, and doubt that
God is for the sinner&mdash;for any sinner&mdash;for him&mdash;for
the reader of these lines? Who would not confide
in that love that shines in the cross? Who can
look at the cross and not see that God willeth not
the death of any sinner? Why did He not allow us
to perish in our guilt&mdash;to descend into that everlasting
hell which we so richly deserved because of our
sins? Why give His Only-begotten Son? Why
bruise Him on that shameful cross? Why hide
His face from the only perfect Man that ever lived&mdash;that
Man His own Eternal Son? Why all this,
reader? Surely it was because God is for us, spite
of all our guilt and sinful rebellion. Yes, blessed
be His Name, He is for the poor self-destroyed,
hell-deserving sinner, be he who or what he may;
and each one whose eye scans these lines is now
entreated to come and confide in the love that gave
Jesus from the bosom and bruised Him on the cross.</p>

<p>Oh! beloved reader, do come, just now. Delay
not! Waver not! Reason not! Listen not to
Satan! Listen not to the suggestions and imaginings
of your own heart; but listen to that word
which assures you that God is for you, and to that
love which shines forth in the gift and the death of
His Son.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In pursuing what we may truly call the golden
chain of evidence in proof that God is for us, we
have dwelt upon the two precious facts of the gift
and the death of His Son. We have traveled from
the bosom to the cross, along that mysterious and
marvelous path which is marked by the footprints
of divine and everlasting love. We have seen the
blessed One not only giving His only begotten
Son from His bosom, but actually bruising Him for
us&mdash;making His spotless soul an offering for sin&mdash;bringing
Him down into the dust of death&mdash;making
Him to be sin for us&mdash;judging Him in our stead&mdash;thus
affording the most unanswerable evidence of
the fact that He is for us, that His heart is toward
us, that He earnestly desires our salvation, seeing
that He hath not withheld His Son, His only Son
from us, but delivered Him up for us all.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to our third proof, which
is furnished by</p>

<p class="center">THE RAISING OF HIS SON.</p>

<p>And in speaking of the glorious fact of resurrection,
we must confine ourselves to the one point therein,
namely, the proof which it furnishes of God's being
friendly to us. A passage or two of Scripture will
suffice to unfold and establish this special point.</p>

<p>In Romans iv., the inspired apostle introduces
God to our hearts as the One who raised Jesus our
Lord from the dead. He is speaking of Abraham
who, He tells us, "against hope believed in hope,
that he might become the father of many nations,
according to that which was spoken, So shall thy
seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered
not his own body now dead, when he was about
an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of
Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promise of
God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving
glory to God; and being fully persuaded that
what He had promised, He was able also to perform.
And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
Now it was not written for his sake alone
that it was imputed to him; but for us also, to whom
it shall be imputed, if we believe on Him that"&mdash;what?
That gave His Son? Nay. That bruised
His Son upon the cross? Nay. What then? "That
raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead"&mdash;the very
same "who was delivered for our offences, and was
raised again for our justification."</p>

<p>Anxious reader, weigh this great fact. What was
it that brought the precious Saviour to the cross?
What brought Him down to the dust of death? Was
it not our offences? Truly so. "He was delivered
for our offences." He was nailed to the cursed tree
for us. He represented us on the cross. He was
our Substitute, in all the full value and deep significance
of that word. He took our place and was
treated, in every respect, as we deserve to be treated.
The hand of infinite justice dealt with our sins&mdash;all
our sins, at the cross. Jesus made Himself responsible
for all our offences, our iniquities, our
transgressions, our liabilities, all that was or ever
could be against us; He&mdash;blessed be His peerless
and adorable name!&mdash;made Himself answerable for
all, and died in our stead, under the full weight of
our sins. He died, the just for the unjust.</p>

<p>Where is He now? The heart bounds with ineffable
joy and holy triumph at the thought of the
answer. Where is the blessed One who hung on
yonder cross, and lay in yonder tomb? He is at
the right hand of God, crowned with glory and honor.
Who set Him there? Who put the crown
upon His blessed brow? God Himself. The One
who gave Him, and the One who bruised Him is
the One who raised Him, and it is in Him we are
to believe if we are to be counted righteous. This
is the special point before the apostle's mind.
Righteousness shall be imputed to us if we believe
on God as the One who raised Jesus our Lord from
the dead.</p>

<p>Mark the vital link. Seize the all-important connection.
The selfsame One who hung upon the
cross, charged with all our offences, is now on the
throne without them. How did He get there? Was
it in virtue of His eternal Godhead? No: for on
that ground He was always there. He was God
over all blessed forever. Was it in virtue of His
eternal Sonship? Nay; for He was ever there on that
ground also.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Therefore, it could, in no wise, meet
our need as guilty sinners, charged with innumerable
offences, to be told that the eternal Son of the Father
had taken His seat at the right hand of the majesty
in the heavens, inasmuch as that place ever belonged
to Him&mdash;yea, the very deepest and tenderest place
in the bosom of the Father.</p>

<p>But, further, we may inquire, was it as the spotless,
sinless, perfect Man that our adorable Lord
took His seat on the throne? Nay; as such, He
could, at any moment, between the manger and the
cross, have taken His place there.</p>

<p>To what conclusion, then, are we absolutely shut
up, in this matter? To that most precious, that
tranquilizing conclusion, that the selfsame One who
was delivered for our offences, bruised for our iniquities,
judged in our stead, is now in heaven; that
the One who represented us on the cross, is now on
the throne; that the One who stood charged with
all our guilt, is now crowned with glory and honor;
that, so perfectly, so absolutely and completely, has
He disposed of the entire question of our sins, that
infinite justice has raised Him from the dead, and
placed a diadem of glory upon His sacred brow.</p>

<p>Reader, dost thou understand this? Dost thou see
its bearing upon thyself? Dost thou believe in the
One who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead?
Dost thou see that, in so doing, He has declared
Himself friendly to thee? And dost thou believe
that, in raising up Jesus, He set forth His infinite
satisfaction in the great work of atonement, and
furnished thee with a receipt in full for all thy debts&mdash;a
receipt for the "ten thousand talents."</p>

<p>Here lies the gist, marrow, and substance of this
magnificent argument of Romans iv. If the Man
who was delivered for our offences is now in heaven,&mdash;in
heaven, too, by the hand and act of God Himself;
then, most surely, our offences are all gone,
and we stand justified from all things, as free from
every charge of guilt, and every breath of condemnation,
as the blessed One Himself. It cannot possibly
be otherwise, if we believe on Him who raised
up Jesus our Lord from the dead. It is utterly impossible
for a charge to be brought against the believer
in the God of resurrection, for the simplest of
all reasons that the One whom He raised was the
One whom He bruised for the believer's sins. Why
did He raise Him? Because the sins for which He
bruised Him were all put away, and put away forever.
The Lord Jesus, <i>having undertaken our cause,
and made Himself answerable for us in every way</i>,
could not be where He now is, if a single jot or tittle
of our guilt remained. But, on the other hand, being
where He now is, and being there by God's own
act, it is impossible&mdash;utterly impossible&mdash;for any
question to be raised as to the full and complete justification
and perfect righteousness of the soul that
believes in Him. Thus, the moment that any one
believes in God, in the special character of the raiser
of Jesus, he is counted perfectly righteous before
Him. This is most marvellous, but divinely and
eternally true. May the reader feel its power,
sweetness, and tranquilizing virtue! Yea, may the
eternal Spirit give him the blessed sense of it, deep
down in his heart! Then, indeed shall he have
perfect peace in his soul; then, too, shall he understand
how that, in raising, as well as in bruising
and giving His Son, God has declared and proved
Himself to be for us.</p>

<p>We had intended to bring under the special notice
of the reader Hebrews xiii. 20, but we must allow
him to dwell upon that lovely passage for himself,
while we proceed to exhibit our fourth proof that
God is for us, which will be found in</p>

<p class="center">THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST.</p>

<p>Here, too, we must confine ourselves to one point
in that most glorious event, and that is the form in
which that august witness, the eternal Spirit, descended.</p>

<p>Let the reader turn to the second chapter of the
Acts. "And when the day of Pentecost was fully
come, they were all with one accord in one place.
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as
of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house
where they were sitting. And there appeared unto
them <i>cloven tongues</i>, like as of fire, and it sat upon
each of them. And they were all filled with the
Holy Ghost, and began to speak with <i>other tongues</i>,
as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were
dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, <i>out of every
nation under heaven</i>. Now, when this was noised
abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded,
because that every man heard them speak
<i>in his own language</i>. And they were all amazed and
marveled, saying one to another, Behold, are not
all these which speak Galileans? And how hear
we <i>every man in our own tongue wherein we were
born</i>? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the
dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia,
in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia,
in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about
Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak <i>in our
tongues</i>, the wonderful works of God."</p>

<p>Here then we mark one special fact&mdash;a fact of
deepest interest&mdash;three times referred to in the foregoing
quotation. It is this, the Holy Ghost came
down to speak to every man "in his own dialect"&mdash;not
the dialect in which he was <i>educated</i> merely, but
"<i>in which he was born</i>"&mdash;the very dialect in which his
mother first whispered into his infant ears, the sweet
and tender accents of a mother's love. Such was
the medium, such the vehicle which the divine Messenger
adopted for the blessed purpose of making
known to man that God was for us. He did not
speak to the Hebrew in Greek, or to the Greek in
Latin. He spoke to each one in the language which
he understood, in the plain vernacular&mdash;the mother
tongue. If there was any peculiarity in that mother
tongue, any idiom, any provincialism in the dialect
of each, the blessed Spirit would make use of it for
the purpose of reaching the heart with the sweet
story of grace.</p>

<p>Contrast with this the giving of the law from
Mount Sinai. There Jehovah confined Himself
absolutely to one language. If persons had been
gathered there "from every nation under heaven,"
they would not have understood a single syllable.
The law&mdash;the ten words&mdash;the record of <i>man's duty</i>
to God and to his neighbor was sedulously wrapped
up in one tongue. But when "<i>the wonderful works
of God</i>" were to be published&mdash;when the blessed
story of love was to be told out&mdash;when the heart of
God towards poor guilty sinners was to be revealed,
was one language enough? No! "Every nation
under heaven" must hear, and hear, too, in their
own mother tongue.</p>

<p>Reader, is not this a telling fact? It will perhaps
be said that those who heard Peter and the rest on
the day of Pentecost, were Jews. Well, that in no
wise robs our fact of its charm, its sweetness, and
its power. Our fact is that when the eternal Spirit
descended from heaven, to tell of the resurrection
of Christ, to tell of accomplished redemption&mdash;to
publish the glad tidings of salvation&mdash;to preach
repentance and remission of sins&mdash;He did not confine
Himself to one language, but spoke in every
dialect under heaven!</p>

<p>And why? Because He desired to make man
understand what He had to say to him&mdash;He desired
to reach his heart with the sweet tidings of redeeming
love&mdash;the soul-stirring message of full remission
of sins. When the law was to be given&mdash;when
Jehovah had to speak to man about his duty&mdash;when
He had to address him in such terms as, "Thou
shalt do this, and thou shalt not do that," He confined
Himself to one solitary language. But when
He would unfold the precious secret of His love&mdash;when
He would prove to man that He was for him,
He, blessed forever be His name, took care to speak
in every language under heaven, so that every man
might hear, in his own dialect wherein he was born,
the wonderful works of God.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Thus, then, in our series of proofs&mdash;our golden
chain of evidence, we have traveled from the bosom
of God to the cross of Christ, and from that precious
cross back to the throne&mdash;we have marked the giving,
the bruising, and the raising of the Son; we
have seen the very heart of God told out in deep
and marvelous love, and tender compassion toward
guilty perishing sinners. Moreover, we have marked
the descent of the eternal Spirit, from the throne of
God&mdash;His mission to this world to announce to
every creature under heaven the glad tidings of a
full, free, and everlasting salvation, through the
blood of the Lamb, and to announce these tidings
not in an unknown tongue, but in the very tongue
wherein each was born.</p>

<p>What more remains? Is there yet another link
to be added to the chain? Yes; there is</p>

<p class="center">THE POSSESSION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be said that our fifth proof is involved
in our fourth, inasmuch as the fact of my possessing
a copy of the Bible in my mother tongue is, in
reality, the Holy Ghost speaking to me in the language
in which I was born.</p>

<p>True; but still, so far as the reader is concerned,
the fact that God has put into his hand or within
his reach the sacred volume&mdash;the inestimable boon,
the holy Scriptures&mdash;is an additional proof that He
is for him. For why were we not left in ignorance
and total darkness? Why was the divine book put
into our hands? Why, each one may say, for himself
and herself, was I thus favored? Why was I
not left to live and die in heathen blindness? Why
was the heavenly lamp allowed to cast its precious
beams on me&mdash;even me?</p>

<p>Ah! beloved reader, the answer is, "Because God
is for thee." Yes, for thee, notwithstanding all thy
many sins&mdash;for thee, spite of all thy forgetfulness,
ingratitude and rebellion&mdash;for thee, although as thou
very well knowest, thou canst not shew a single
reason why He should not be against thee. He
gave His Son from His bosom, bruised Him on the
cross, raised Him from the dead, sent down the Holy
Ghost, put into your very hands His blessed book,
all to shew you that He is for you, that His heart is
toward you, that He earnestly desires your salvation.</p>

<p>And mark, we pray thee, thou canst not say, nor
wilt thou ever dare to say, "I could not understand
the Bible; it was beyond me; it was full of abstruse
mysteries which I could not fathom; of difficulties
which I could not solve; of discrepancies which I
could not reconcile. And when I turned to those
who professed to be Christians, I found them split
up into almost innumerable sects, and divided into
almost endless schools of doctrine. And, not only
so, but I saw such utter hollowness, such gross inconsistency,
such flagrant contradiction between
profession and practice, that I was forced to abandon
the whole subject of religion with a mingled
feeling of perplexity, contempt, and disgust."</p>

<p>These objections will not stand in the judgment,
nor keep thee out of the lake that burneth with fire
and brimstone. Remember this. Yes, ponder it
deeply. Let not the devil, let not thine own heart
deceive thee. What does Abraham say to the rich
man, in Luke xvi.? "They have Moses and the
prophets, <i>let them hear them</i>." Why does the rich
man not reply, "They cannot understand them?"
He dare not.</p>

<p>No, reader; a child can understand the holy
Scriptures, which are able to make us wise unto salvation
through faith which is in Christ Jesus. There
is not one beneath the canopy of God's heaven, who
possesses a copy of the holy Scriptures, who is not
solemnly responsible before God for the use he
makes of them. If professing Christians were split
up into ten thousand times as many sects as they
are; if they were ten thousand times as inconsistent
as they are; if schools and doctors of divinity were
ten thousand times more conflicting than they are&mdash;still
the word to each possessor of the Bible is,
"You have Moses and the prophets, and the New
Testament, hear them."</p>

<p>Oh! that we could persuade the unconverted, the
unawakened, the unbelieving reader to think of these
things, to think of them now, to ponder them, in
the very hidden depths of his moral being, to give
them his heart's undivided attention, ere it be too
late. We contemplate, with ever-deepening horror,
the condition of a lost soul in hell&mdash;of one opening
his eyes, in that place of endless torment, to the tremendous
fact that God is against him and against
him forever; that all hope is gone; that nothing
can ever bridge the chasm that separates the region
of the lost from the heaven of the redeemed; that
"there is a great gulf <i>fixed</i>."</p>

<p>We cannot proceed. The thought is really overpowering.
The heart is crushed by the appalling
contemplation. Dear, dear reader, do let us entreat
of thee, ere we lay down the pen, to turn, this very
hour, to a dear loving Saviour who stands with open
arms and open bosom to receive all who come to
Him, and who assures thee that "him that cometh
unto Me I will in no wise cast out." Do come and trust
in God's faithful word and Christ's finished work.</p>

<p>Here lies the precious secret of the whole matter.
Look away from self, look straight to Jesus, confide
simply in Him, and in what He has done for thee
on the cross, and all thy sins shall be blotted out,
divine righteousness shall be thine, eternal life, sonship,
an indwelling Spirit, an all-prevailing Advocate,
a bright home in the heavens, a portion in
Christ's eternal glory&mdash;yes, reader, if thou wilt but
believe in Jesus all shall be thine&mdash;Himself the best
of all.</p>

<p>May the Holy Ghost lead thee, this moment, to
the feet of Jesus, and enable thee to cry out, in holy
triumph, "If God be for us, who can be against us?"
God grant it for Jesus Christ's sake!</p>

<h2>THE CALL OF GOD</h2>

<h3>GEN CHAPTER XII</h3>


<p>In a day of such widely extended profession as the
present, it is specially important that Christians
should be deeply impressed with the necessity
of realizing <i>personally the call of God</i>, without which
there can be no permanency or steadiness in the
Christian course.</p>

<p>It is a comparatively easy thing to make a profession
at a time when profession prevails; but it is
never easy to walk by faith&mdash;it is never easy to give
up present things, in the hope of "good things to
come." Nothing but that mighty principle which the
apostle denominates "<i>the substance</i> of things hoped
for, the evidence of things not seen" (Heb. xi. 1),
can ever enable a man to persevere in a course
which in a world where all is wrong&mdash;all out of
order, must be thorny and difficult. We must feel
"<i>persuaded</i>" of something yet to come&mdash;something
worth waiting for&mdash;something that will reward all
the toil of a pilgrim's protracted course, ere we
rise up out of the circumstances of nature and the
world, to "run with patience the race that is set before
us." (Heb. xii. 1.)</p>

<p>All this is fully exemplified in Abraham, and the
exemplification receives additional force from the
contrast exhibited in the character of Lot and
others who are introduced in the course of the narrative.</p>

<p>In the seventh of Acts, we have the following
words which bear directly upon the subject before
us. "The God of glory appeared unto our father
Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he
dwelt in Charran, and said unto him, Get thee out
of thy country and from thy kindred, and come into
the land that <i>I shall show thee</i>." (Vers. 1, 2.) Here
then we are presented with the first dawning of that
light which attracted Abraham out of the darkness
of "Ur, of the Chaldees," and which shining in
upon his wearisome path, from time to time, gave
fresh vigor to his soul, as he journeyed in quest of
"that city which hath foundations, whose builder and
maker is God." "The God of glory" caused Abraham
to see, in the light of His character, the true
condition of things in Ur, and further, to believe,
as some one has observed, <i>a report concerning future
glory and inheritance</i>, and he therefore hesitates not,
but instantly girds himself up for the journey.</p>

<p>However, upon a close comparison of the opening
of the seventh of Acts, with the first verse of
this twelfth chapter of Genesis, we get an important
principle. From the time that God appeared unto
Abraham, until he finally gets up into the land of
Canaan, an event occurs involving much deep instruction
to us. I allude to the death of Abraham's
father, as we read in Acts vii. "From thence, <i>when
his father</i> was dead, He removed him into this land
wherein ye now dwell." (Ver. 4.) This will enable
us to understand the force of the expression in Gen.
xii., "The Lord <i>had</i> said unto Abram," etc. (Ver. 1.)
From both these passages, it would plainly appear
the movement made by Terah and his family, recorded
in Gen. x. 31, was the result of a revelation
made by "the God of glory" to Abram, but it
would not appear that <i>Terah</i> had received any such
revelation from God. He is presented to us rather
as a hindrance to Abram than any thing else, for
until he died, Abram did not come into the land
of Canaan&mdash;his divinely appointed destination.</p>

<p>Now, this circumstance, trivial as it may seem to
a cursory reader, confirms in the strongest manner
the statement already advanced, namely, that unless
the call of God&mdash;the revelation from "the God of
glory" be <i>personally realized</i>, there can be no permanency
or steadiness in the Christian course. Had
Terah realized that call, he would neither have
been a clog to Abram in his path of faith, nor yet
would he have dropped off, like a mere child of
nature, ere reaching the future land of promise. We
get the same principle illustrated in Laban afterward
in Gen. xxiv. Laban, as some one has well
observed, was fully alive to the value of the gold
and silver jewels which the servant of Abraham had
brought with him, but he had no heart to value <i>the
report</i> concerning future things, which dropped from
his lips. In other words, he did not receive a revelation
from "the God of glory," and as a consequence,
he remained, as the same writer has observed,
"<i>a thorough man of the world</i>."</p>

<p>In the conversion of Saul of Tarsus, we are taught
the same truth. There were other persons with him
when he was struck to the ground by the lustre of
the glory of the Lord Jesus; these persons "saw
indeed the light"&mdash;they witnessed many of the
external circumstances which had arrested the furious
zealot; but as he himself states, "<i>they heard
not the voice of Him that spake</i> <small>TO ME</small>." (Acts xxii. 9.)
Here is the grand point. The voice must speak "<i>to
me</i>"&mdash;"the God of glory" must appear "to me,"
ere I can take the place of a pilgrim and stranger
in the world, and perseveringly, "run the race that
is set before me." It is not <i>national faith</i>, nor <i>family
faith</i>, but <i>personal faith</i> that will constitute us real
witnesses for God in the world.</p>

<p>But when Abram was released from the clog
which he had experienced in the person of his
father, he was enabled to enter with vigor and decision
upon the path of faith&mdash;a path which "flesh
and blood" can never tread&mdash;a thorny path beset
with difficulties from first to last, in which God
alone can sustain the soul. "And Abram passed
through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the
plain of Moreh. <i>And the Canaanite was then in the
land.</i> And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and
said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: <i>and there
builded he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto
him</i>." (Gen. xii. 6, 7.) Here Abram at once takes
his stand as <i>a worshiper</i>, in the face of "the Canaanite."
The altar marks him as one who, having been
delivered from the idols of Ur of the Chaldees, had
been taught to bow before the altar of the one true
God, "who made heaven and earth." In the following
verse, we get the second grand feature in the
character of the man of faith, namely, "<i>the tent</i>,"
denoting strangership in the world. "By faith he
sojourned in the land of promise, as in a <i>strange</i>
<i>country, dwelling in tabernacles</i> with Isaac and Jacob,
<i>the heirs</i> with him of the same <i>promise</i>." (Heb. xi. 9.)</p>

<p>We shall have occasion to notice more fully, as
we proceed, these two important points in the life
of Abraham, and shall therefore rest satisfied for the
present with establishing the fact that the tent and
the altar do most clearly present him to us as a
<i>stranger</i> and a <i>worshiper</i>, and that as such, he was
a man entirely separated from the course of this evil
world.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Abram entered upon his course,
when he had to encounter one of those difficulties
which have a special tendency to test the genuineness
of faith, both as to its quality and its object.
"And there was a famine in the land." The difficulty
meets him in the very place into which the
Lord had called him. Now, it is no easy matter
when we perceive trial and sorrow, privation and
difficulty awaiting us, while walking in "the strait
and narrow way," still to persevere&mdash;still to pursue
the onward path, and especially if we observe within
our reach, as Abram did, an entire exemption
from the particular trial under which we may be
smarting. The men of this world "are not in trouble
as other men, neither are they plagued as other
men." This feeling is still further increased by the
entire absence of every thing, as far as sight is concerned,
which could act as a confirmation of our
hope. Abram had not so much as to set his foot
upon&mdash;famine was raging around him on every side,
<i>save in Egypt</i>. Could he only find himself <i>there</i>, he
would be able to live in ease and abundance.</p>

<p>Here, however, the man of faith must pursue
the path of simple obedience. God had said, "Get
thee out of thy country ... unto a land that I will
show thee." Abram may, it is true, afterward discover
that obedience to this command will involve
his abiding in a land where nothing but starvation,
apparently, awaits him. But even though it should
be so, God had not in any way qualified the command.
No, the word was simple and definite: "Into
a land that <i>I</i> will show thee." This should have
been as true and as binding upon Abram when
famine reigned around him, as when peace and
abundance prevailed. Famine should not, therefore,
have induced him to leave the land, neither
should abundance have induced him to remain.
The influential words were, "I will show thee."</p>

<p>But Abram leaves this land&mdash;he succumbs, for
the moment, to the heavy trial, and bends his footsteps
down to Egypt, leaving behind him his tent
and altar. There he obtained ease and luxury; he
escaped, no doubt, the formidable trial under which
he had suffered in the land of promise; but he lost,
for the time being, his worship and strangership,&mdash;things
which should ever be dearest to the heart
of a pilgrim.</p>

<p>There is nothing in Egypt for Abram to feed
upon as a spiritual man; it might, and doubtless
did, afford abundance for him as a natural man, but
that was all. Egypt would give nothing to Abram
unless he sacrificed his character both as a stranger
and as a worshiper of God. It is needless to observe
that it is exactly so at this very hour. There is
plenty in the world upon which our old nature could
feed most luxuriously. There are the rich delights
"of the flesh and of the mind," and abundant
means of gratifying the desires of the heart, but
what of all these, if the enjoyment thereof leads, as
it must necessarily do, right out of the path of faith&mdash;the
path of simple obedience.</p>

<p>Here then is the question for the Christian: which
shall I have, the gold and silver, the flocks and
herds&mdash;the present ease and affluence of Egypt, or
the tent and altar of "the land of promise"? Which
shall I have: the carnal ease and delight of the
world, or a peaceful holy walk with God <i>here</i>, and
eternal blessedness and glory hereafter? We cannot
have both, for, "if <i>any man</i> love the world, the
love of the Father is not in him."</p>

<p>But, we may ask, why was it that Abram had to
experience famine and trial in the land of promise?
Why did he not find a home and plenty there? Simply
because "the Canaanite and Perizzite dwelt
then in the land." (Chap. xiii. 7.) The land had
not as yet been fitted up to be the residence of
God's redeemed ones. Abram's faith might have
enabled him to penetrate through the long and
dreary period which should intervene ere the promise
could be consummated; but that very principle
of faith it was that made him "a pilgrim and a
stranger." He could wait for God's time, and until
then remain without "so much as to set his foot
on." (Acts vii. 5.) So should it be now.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p>This beautiful chapter shows us the man of faith
recovering himself, through the faithfulness and
loving-kindness of God, who never allows such to
wander far, or tarry long away. The gold and
silver, the flocks and herds of Egypt, could not long
prove a satisfying portion for Abram, while deprived
of his tent and his altar, and he therefore
once more, in the renewed energy of faith rises, as
it were, from the dust of Egypt, and retraces his
steps to the land of promise. Happy recovery!
Certain evidence of a fixed and honest purpose to
serve the Lord. "The ship may be tossed by the
waves and the winds, but <i>the magnet still points to
the north</i>."</p>

<p>But some expressions in the opening of this chapter
confirm most fully a thought already expressed,
namely, that Abram gained nothing, "as before
God," by his visit to Egypt. Thus, for example,
"Abram went on his journeys ... unto the place
where his tent had been <i>at the beginning</i>, unto the
place of the altar which he had made there <i>at the
first</i>." (Vers. 3, 4.) The words "beginning," and "at
the first," prove that Abram had made no progress
while in Egypt, but that, while there, all his time
was, as it were, lost. No doubt he learnt a wholesome
lesson, and it is well when by our failures we
learn to distrust our own hearts, and dread the pernicious
influence of the world. Abram learnt that
there could be no tent or altar in Egypt. It is only
faith that can enable a man to raise an altar or erect
a tent, but in Egypt all is sight and not faith, and
hence, the moment Abram set his foot there he
ceased to show forth the genuine fruits of faith&mdash;yea,
the very principle which led him to leave the
land of promise, led him, at the same time, to relinquish
his character as a stranger and a worshiper.</p>

<p>How forcibly are we here reminded of a proposal
made long after this, by a king of Egypt, to Abraham's
seed. "And Pharaoh called for Moses and
Aaron, and said: Go ye, sacrifice to your God in
the land." (Ex. viii. 25.) Thus, it would seem ever
to have been the design of the enemy to get the people
of God, the holy seed, to defile themselves by
worshiping or sacrificing to God, <i>in the world</i>; i. e.,
to make their character, as worshipers of God, accord
with that of men of the world&mdash;men holding a
place in society where Christ is an outcast; thus, of
course, declaring that there is no difference between
the religion of the world and the religion of God&mdash;a
truly fearful delusion, calculated to lead many
souls out of the way of truth and holiness.</p>

<p>It is most sad to hear, at times, those who surely
ought to know better, in order, as they say, to manifest
a <i>liberal spirit</i>, speaking of the religion of the
world in all its multiplied forms, as if it were all
right; or, as if it were a matter of total indifference
whether we remained in communion with error or
not. Oh, let us not be deceived! God's principle
of separation is as strong and as binding to-day
as it was in the days of Abram or Moses. "Come
out from among them, and be ye separate, and
touch not the unclean thing," must hold good as
long as the "unclean thing" exists; nor can any
outward form alter the character&mdash;the true essential
character of "the unclean thing" so as to make it
"a clean thing."</p>

<p>Moses, then, was not liberal, in the above acceptation
of the word, for he at once refused to countenance
the religion of the world. "It is not meet so
to do." Memorable words! Would that there were
more amongst us who, when invited to countenance
the religion of the world, would reply, "It is not
meet so to do." Abram could not worship in
Egypt, neither could his seed.</p>

<p>But Abram had more difficulties than one to encounter
in his course. The path which every man
of faith is called to tread lies between two dangerous
extremes. One is the temptation to return to
the world; the other, to strive with brethren by the
way. Abram had just recovered himself from the
effects of the former, and we have now to behold
him buffeting the latter.</p>

<p>The moment Abram emerged from Egypt, he appeared
in a special manner to move under a new
responsibility, namely, responsibility to his brother
to walk with him in harmony. While in Egypt, this
responsibility stood quite in the shade. The institutions&mdash;laws&mdash;habits&mdash;luxury
and ease of Egypt,
would in an eminent degree tend to do away with
every such feeling. All these things would have had
the effect of erecting barriers around each individual
tending to prevent him from recognizing the
fact that he was his "brother's keeper." Nor is it
otherwise now. So long as we continue in the world&mdash;the
religious world, as it is termed&mdash;we shall find
ourselves completely relieved from the difficult task
of being our "brother's keeper." Those who advocate
a continuance therein may deny this fact, but it
is all in vain, for Scripture and experience alike
demonstrate it. Abram and Lot <i>did not strive in
Egypt</i>, and a religious establishment presents this
attraction at least&mdash;and it is by no means a feeble
one&mdash;it effectually prevents <i>brotherly collision</i>; and,
of course, where there is no collision there can be no
strife&mdash;no dispute; where collision takes place,
there must be either grace to enable us to walk in
unity of mind, or strife and contention. But Egypt
saps the very springs of grace by leading us out of
a place of simple dependence upon the Lord, (for
dependence ever genders grace and forbearance)
and because she does so, she, at the same time,
teaches us, or attempts at least to teach us, that we
do not need grace, by leading us into a sphere in
which responsibility to brethren is never realized,
thus the need is not felt; weakness is mistaken for
strength, folly for wisdom.</p>

<p>When the Christian at first starts on his course,
he fondly dreams of nothing but perfection in his
fellow Christians; but in this he soon finds himself
mistaken, for we have all our infirmities, and as the
apostle states, "In many things we offend all."
But why, we may ask, was there such a speedy development
of infirmity upon their coming up out of
Egypt? Because they were now called to walk in
the power of a naked principle, without any of the
props or barriers of Egypt. They were called to
walk by faith, and "faith worketh by love."</p>

<p>Now "the Canaanite," etc., "was then in the
land." This should have acted as a hindrance to
any strife between "<i>brethren</i>," for the Canaanite
cannot understand anything about the infirmities
of believers, and he therefore puts all their failure
down to some defect in the principle professed.</p>

<p>But in every strife between brethren, there must
be fault somewhere. In the contention between
Paul and Barnabas there was fault somewhere. Nor
can we be at any loss to decide where it lay. Barnabas
wished to take <i>his relative</i> with him, but this
relative had before proved himself unfit, or at least
unwilling, to "endure hardness," therefore it could
not have been with a single eye to the Lord's work
that Barnabas desired his company. The Lord
Himself, too, at once takes Paul's side of the question
by providing him with a dear son and fellow-laborer,
in the person of Timothy, with whom he
had "none like-minded."</p>

<p>So it is exactly in the case before us. We can
have no hesitation in asserting that Lot was the man
in error here. Lot does not appear to have fully
got rid of the spirit of the world, and where there
is this spirit predominating in any one he will ever
find the path of faith too strait for him to walk in,
and so it was, "They could not dwell together."</p>

<p>If, then, it be asked on what grounds one would
pronounce Lot to have been in the wrong? The answer
is, first, Lot's subsequent conduct; and, second,
the Lord's dealings with Abram, "after that Lot was
separated from him."</p>

<p>What then did Lot do? "<i>He lifted up his eyes.</i>"
This is ever our mode of acting when not under the
direct power of faith. Whenever we lift up our
eyes without divine direction, we are sure to go
wrong. I say, without divine direction, for we find
the Lord afterwards directing Abram to lift up his
eyes, but then that was totally different from Lot's
act, which was simply the suggestion of mere human
wisdom and foresight. Human wisdom and foresight,
however, can never assist our progress as
men of faith&mdash;no, quite the reverse; human wisdom
will ever suggest things which, if acted upon, will
lead us right athwart the path of a man of faith.
Therefore Lot, in lifting up his eyes, could not penetrate
beyond the "things that are seen and temporal."
Such was the utmost bound of his range of
vision. The things on which his eyes rested were
those with which he had been conversant while in
Egypt, as we read, "He beheld all the plain of Jordan
that it was well watered every where ... <i>like
the land of Egypt</i>." (10.) Here we observe that Lot
had never been really detached in heart and affection
from Egypt&mdash;he had never learnt the vanity
and unsatisfactoriness of all her resources in the
light of a better order of things&mdash;he had never contrasted
her with that "<i>city which hath foundations</i>,
whose builder and maker is God"&mdash;in a word, he
"having put his hand to the plow," was now beginning
"to look back," and thus to prove himself "unfit
for the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>There is a striking notice of all this afforded in
the opening verse of this chapter, "Abram went up
out of Egypt and <i>Lot with him</i>." Here we get the
secret of Lot's after instability. He appears to have
gone up rather <i>with Abram</i> than <i>with God</i>, and the
consequence was that, when he parted with Abram,
he had nothing to lean upon. He had been hitherto
moving under Abram's protection and guidance
instead of being directly before the Lord, and
therefore when he lost Abram he went astray.</p>

<p>Now then is the moment for Abram to "lift up
his eyes," at the Lord's command, and oh, what a
different range of vision was his! While Lot could
not penetrate beyond the narrow limits of the present
scene, Abram was enabled to survey the length
and breadth of God's inheritance. He soars on the
strong and rapid pinion of faith, and is, as it were,
lost in the unbounded beneficence of God; while
Lot, the man walking by sight, is well-nigh lost in
the deep gulf of Sodom's corruption.</p>

<p>Let us then, ere we enter upon the next chapter,
take a view of the different circumstances of these
two men who had started together. "Lot lifted up
his eyes," and the prospect on which they rested
was, as might be expected, such as suited his natural
desires, "well-watered plains," which, however
fair in man's view, were nevertheless, in the sight
of the Lord, filled with exceeding wickedness.
(Comp. vers. 10 and 14.) Abram, on the contrary,
had allowed his eye to wander over the length and
breadth of the <i>promised</i> inheritance&mdash;uninfluenced
by all else, he viewed the portion which God was
<i>reserving</i> for him and his seed, and took up his position
accordingly.</p>

<p>Thus do we find Lot in the unhallowed region of
Sodom; and Abram&mdash;the pilgrim and stranger, with
his tent and altar&mdash;"in the plain of Mamre, which
is in Hebron."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p>Here we have a very minute account of a battle
fought by "four kings with five," and we may ask,
What connection had this strife between "the potsherds
of the earth," with the history of the people
of God? With Abram indeed none, in one sense,
for <i>he</i> was outside it all. <i>His tent</i> marked him as a
stranger to all these things&mdash;it marked him as one
to whom the battle of "four kings with five" would
be a matter of very trivial moment. And then his
altar marked him as one whose pursuits were quite
of another character, even a heavenly. His tent
showed him to be a stranger on earth&mdash;his altar
showed him to be at home in heaven. Happy man!
Happy pilgrim! who could thus from his high
elevation, even the lofty watch-tower of faith, look
down, as a passer-by, upon the battle fields of an evil
world. It mattered not to Abram whether the laurel
of victory were about to wreath the brow of the king
of Sodom, or of Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; his
portion was not in danger through their strife, because
he had it in that place "where thieves <i>do not</i>break through and steal."</p>

<p>But, though it was the happy lot of Abram to
have his being and his portion in a place where
wars could have no influence, yet such was not the
case with his more worldly-minded brother. His
position was such as to place him in the midst of
the strife, and consequently the issue of this battle
could not fail to be of the deepest moment to him.
If the child of God will stoop so low as to mix himself
up with the world, he must calculate upon being
made a participator in its convulsions, and woe be
to that man who shall have his portion in the world
in that day (now fast approaching) when all things
shall be shaken by the mighty hand of God in
judgment.</p>

<p>I would here observe that what has ever made
the history of nations and the movements of mighty
kings and conquerors, matters of interest to the
Holy Spirit, has been the connection of such things
with the history of the people of God. Beyond this
they possessed nothing of moment to Him. He
could find no pleasure in dwelling upon the abstract
history of man. The busy strife and tumult of nations&mdash;the
fierce contests of ungodly tyrants grasping
after power&mdash;the movements of armies, could
not attract the notice of the Spirit of peace; nevertheless,
when such things became, in the least degree,
connected with the history of a "righteous
soul," the Holy Ghost can be most minute in detailing
the circumstances of a battle, as is observable
in the case under consideration.</p>

<p>What then were the results of this contest to Lot?
Ruin to him and his family. He was made prisoner
and all his goods were taken. (Ver. 12.) He had
laid up treasure for himself upon earth, and the
thieves had broken through; and thus, while Abram
was above it all, in the power&mdash;the separating power
of communion with God, <i>he</i> found himself a prisoner
and a beggar. He had sown to the flesh, and
of the flesh he must now "reap corruption."</p>

<p>But this was just the moment for Abram to show
himself in the powerful activities of love. He had,
as above observed, hitherto surveyed with calm indifference
these movements of "kings and their
armies," but the very same faith which had made him
indifferent about the strifes of men, made him quick
to take cognizance of a <i>brother</i> in distress. Faith
not only purifies the heart from worldly and carnal
desires, but it also "works by love," as is powerfully
shown in Abram's case, for "when Abram saw
that <i>his brother</i> was taken captive he armed his
trained servants," etc. (Ver. 14.)</p>

<p>Now, it is to be observed that it is in the hour of
distress and difficulty that the relationship <i>of brother</i>
gets the prominent place. In days of unruffled
peace, Lot might be known to Abram as "his
brother's son," but now he was in sorrow, and
therefore the claims of brotherhood act, and act
powerfully and effectually.</p>

<p>We are now called to witness a deeply interesting
scene. Abram himself is about to meet a
temptation&mdash;a temptation at once repulsed indeed
by the power of God in him, but nevertheless, a
temptation. The king of Sodom was about to come
forth to display his treasures before the eye of
Abram, and he had by nature a heart to value those
treasures.</p>

<p>That man knows not his own heart who could say
that the world does not present many&mdash;very many
attractions to the natural heart. There is a species
of misanthropy which looks like elevation above the
world, but which, after all, is not it. The Cynic
philosopher Diogenes, when he told Alexander to
get out of his sunshine, was as proud and as worldly
a man as Alexander himself. The only true and
real way in which to be separated from, and elevated
above, the world, is by the knowledge of heavenly
things, and Abram was led, through the mercy of
God, into that knowledge.</p>

<p>But the victory obtained by Abram, was not
owing to any power in himself. He had, as I have
observed, a heart to value the things which the
enemy had to give him; and, therefore, if he triumphed,
it was through the operation of a power outside
himself. In all this transaction, the One who
had watched over His dear servant during the dark
season of his sojourn in Egypt, and who, moreover,
had, by that very sojourn, taught him a lesson as to
the true character of the world, was now closely
observing his ways, and making preparations for
his relief; He was cognizant of the movements and
designs of the enemy, from first to last, and He
therefore prepares to supply a heavenly antidote to
nullify his poison.</p>

<p>It is particularly worthy of observation that between
the time at which the king of Sodom went
forth to meet Abram, and that wherein he made the
proposal to him with reference to "the persons and
the goods," there is a remarkable character introduced,
namely, Melchizedek. This stranger, commissioned
by God, was on his way to fortify Abram's
heart at the very moment when the enemy was on
his way to attack (Comp. ver. 17, 18, and 21). Now,
why did not, "the priest of the Most High God"
come to meet Abram before? Because this was the
very moment in which Abram most needed the
strength which he had to bring. The enemy was
about to display his gilded bait before the eye of the
man of God, and therefore is Melchizedek at hand
to display in his view the divine realities of the
kingdom. He was about to feed and strengthen
his soul with the "bread," and cheer him with the
"wine," of the kingdom, in order that, "in the
strength of that meat" he might mount above the
influence of all the allurements of the world. From
all this we may learn that it is communion with the
joys and glories of the kingdom that can alone cause
the heart to reject the pollutions of the world.</p>

<p>Reader, upon what are <i>you</i> now feeding? What
constitutes your habitual food? Is it "the bread
and wine" which the Lord provides, or "the goods"
of Sodom? Are your ears open to the pernicious
suggestions of the <i>King of Sodom</i>, or to the heavenly
communications of the <i>King of Salem</i>? The
Lord grant that our hearts may ever choose that in
which He delights.</p>

<p>But to proceed, Melchizedek leads Abram's soul
into present communion with "<span class="smcap">the Most High
God, the possessor of heaven and earth</span>," and
thus completes the wondrous contrast between "the
King of Sodom" and "the Most High God, possessor
of heaven and earth,"&mdash;"the goods of Sodom"
and the extensive possessions of heaven and earth.
Blessed contrast, which faith ever draws! It is
needless to say that Abram at once rejects the offer
of the King of Sodom. The bread and wine, and
the benediction of "the priest of the Most High
God," had raised Abram to such a height that he
could, in one comprehensive glance, take in the vast
possessions of heaven and earth, and further, look
down from thence upon the despicable proposal of
the King of Sodom and reject it. Melchizedek had
just said, "the Most High God, the possessor of
heaven and earth," and Abram had laid hold on
these words and made use of them in his reply to
the adversary. "I have lifted up my hand," said
he, "to the Lord, the Most High God, the possessor
of heaven and earth, that I will not take from a
thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not
take anything that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,
I have made Abram rich" (vers. 22, 23).</p>

<p>Abram appears to breathe the very atmosphere of
the presence of Him, "who hath measured the waters
in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven
with a span, and comprehended the dust of the
earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in
scales, and the hills in a balance, in whose sight the
nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
as the small dust of the balance. Behold! he taketh
up the isles as a very little thing, and Lebanon
is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
sufficient for a burnt-offering. All nations before
Him are as nothing, and they are counted to
Him as less than nothing and vanity." (Isa. xl. 12,
15-18.)</p>

<p>And surely, we may say, it was only thus that
Abram could triumph; and let no one who moves
not, in some measure, in the same sphere, affect to
despise the world&mdash;nothing can be more truly vain.
There must be the experimental acquaintance with
<i>the</i> better thing&mdash;the fondly cherished hope of
"<i>good things to come</i>"&mdash;ere we can obtain full victory
over present things, and our own worldly desires.
"Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods,
<i>knowing in yourselves</i> that ye have in <i>heaven a better
and an enduring substance</i>" (Heb. x. 34). If we are
really waiting for the manifestation of the glory, we
shall be found standing apart from everything which
will be judged in that day: and it is written, "Yet
once more, I shake not the earth only but also
heaven; and this word, yet once more, signifieth
the removing of those things that are shaken, as of
things that are made, that those things which cannot
be shaken may remain" (Heb. xii. 26, 27).</p>

<p>We have, in the last verse of our truly interesting
chapter, a happy feature in the character of the true
man of faith. Abram would not force others to
walk according to his elevated standard. Although
<i>he</i> might be able to reject, in the most unreserved
manner, the offers of the king of Sodom, yet <i>others</i>
might not be able to do so, and therefore he says,
with regard to "Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, <i>let them</i>
take <i>their portion</i>." Our walk should ever be "according
as God hath dealt to every man the measure
of faith" (Rom. xii. 3). We have seen, in our own
day, many persons led, at the outset, to give up a
variety of worldly things, and afterwards plunge
still deeper into those things; and why? Because
they acted through mere excitement or human influence,
and were not able to say with Abram, "<i>I
have lift up my hand unto the Lord</i>."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p>In the opening verse of this chapter, we have a
principle fraught with comfort and encouragement
to us&mdash;a principle eminently calculated to call out
into full exercise a spirit of true devotedness to the
Lord. We observe here, the Lord's grace in acknowledging
and accepting the sacrifice laid upon
His altar&mdash;the willing offering of the devoted heart
of His servant. Our God is never slow in owning
such things, nor in rewarding them a hundredfold.
Abram had just been manifesting a spirit of self-denial
in refusing the attractive offers of the King
of Sodom. He had refused to be enriched from
such a source, and had taken "the Most High God"
for his portion and his reward, therefore the Lord
comes forth to confirm the soul of his servant with
these words, "Fear not, Abram, I <small>AM</small> thy shield,
and thy exceeding great reward." "God is not unrighteous
to forget the work and labor of love"
(Heb. vi. 10). A similar principle is presented to
us in chapter xiii. where Abram is seen giving way
to Lot, in the matter of choosing the land. Abram's
whole anxiety in that matter was about the Lord's
honor, as maintained in the harmonious walk of
"<i>brethren</i>" before the "Canaanite and the Perizzite."
"Let there be no strife," says he, "between me and
thee ... <i>for we be brethren</i>." Nor did Abram desire
to suppress the strife, by <i>exacting concessions</i>
from Lot. No; he was willing to concede everything
himself&mdash;to surrender every claim&mdash;to sacrifice
every advantage, provided the strife were suppressed.
"Is not the <i>whole land</i> before thee?" <i>Take</i> what
you please&mdash;possess yourself of the fairest spot in
all the region round about. Here, as some one has
observed, is the liberality&mdash;the unselfishness of faith.
What was land to Abram in comparison with the
Lord's glory? Nothing. He could give up anything,
or everything, for that. How then does the
Lord meet this self-sacrifice on the part of His servant?
Just as He does in this xv. chapter, by coming
in, in the plenitude of His goodness, to make it
up to him a hundredfold. "Lift up <i>now</i> thine eyes
... for <i>all the land which thou seest</i> to thee will I
give it, and to thy seed after thee" (xiii. 14, 15).
How truly gracious it is of the Lord to enable His
servant to make a sacrifice for Him, and then reward
that sacrifice by a vast increase of blessing.
Such are His ways&mdash;His ever adorable ways.</p>

<p>We are now called to trace in Abram the development
of a feature which, in a special manner, demonstrates
the high order of his communion with
God. After all God's revelations and promises to
him, his soul still breathes after an object without
which all besides was defective. True, he had surveyed,
with the eye of faith, the promised inheritance&mdash;the
magnificent gift of divine benevolence; yet,
notwithstanding all this, was there a great desideratum&mdash;a
mighty blank. He sighed for a SON. A
son <i>alone</i> could render complete, in Abram's estimation,
all his previous privileges. "And Abram said,
Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless,
and <i>the steward of my house is this Eliezer of
Damascus</i>. And Abram said, Behold to me thou
hast given no seed: and lo, <i>one born in my house</i> is
mine heir" (vers. 2, 3). Now, we have, in tracing
the path of this remarkable man, beheld him, at
times, displaying some very noble features of character.
His generosity&mdash;his high elevation of mind&mdash;his
pilgrim-like habits&mdash;all these things denote a
man of the very highest order; yet I hesitate not to
say, that we find him, in the passage just quoted,
exhibiting a temper of soul, more in harmony with
the mind of heaven than anything we have met hitherto.
Abram desired to have his house enlivened
by the cry of a child. He had been long enough
conversant with the spirit of bondage breathed by
"the steward of his house," but the titles of <i>lord</i> and
<i>master</i>, though all very good in their place, could
not satisfy the heart of Abram, for Abram had been
taught of God, and God ever instructs His children
in those things which He loves, and which He
exhibits in His dealings with them. And I would
just observe, in connection with this, that we see in
the case of the prodigal in Luke xv., the development
of a principle very much in connection with
what we have been saying. He says, in the very
midst of all his misery "I will arise and go unto my
Father, and will say unto him, <i>Father</i>." Here we
have a fine feature in the character of this poor
wanderer. He had such a sense of the grace of
him against whom he had sinned, that he could yet
say "<i>Father</i>" notwithstanding his long course of
rebellion and folly.</p>

<p>But let us observe with what accuracy Abram lays
hold of the great principle afterwards brought out
by the Spirit in Romans viii. "<i>If children, then
heirs.</i>" Abram felt that sonship and heirship were
inseparably connected, so much so, that without the
former the latter could not be. This is the meaning
of his question, "Lord God, what wilt thou give
me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my
house is this Eliezer of Damascus?" Abram rightly
judged that to have "<i>no seed</i>" was to have <i>no inheritance</i>,
for the word is, not if <i>stewards or servants</i>,
then heirs, but "if <i>children</i>, then heirs" (Rom. viii. 17).</p>

<p>How very important it is that we should ever bear
in mind, that all our present privileges and future
prospects stand connected with our character as
"<i>sons</i>." It may be all well and very valuable, in its
right place, to realize our responsibility to act as
"faithful and wise stewards," in the absence of our
Master; still the most ample privileges&mdash;the highest
enjoyments&mdash;the brightest glories, which belong to
us through the grace and mercy of our God, stand
intimately connected with our character and place
as "<i>sons</i>." (Comp. John i. 12; Rom. viii. 14, 19; 1
John iii. 1, 2; Eph. i. 5; v. 1; Heb. xii. 5.)</p>

<p>In the vision presented to us in the close of our
chapter, and which was granted to Abram as an answer
to his question, "Lord God, whereby shall I
know that I shall inherit it?" we have a further
illustration of the teaching of Romans viii. Abram
is taught by the vision, that the <i>inheritance</i> was only
to be reached through <i>suffering</i>&mdash;that <i>the heirs</i> must
pass through <i>the furnace</i>, previous to their entering
upon the enjoyment of that which God was reserving
for them; and I doubt not that, were we more
deeply and experimentally taught in the divine life,
we should more fully apprehend the moral fitness of
such training. Suffering then, is not connected, in
this chapter, with <i>sonship</i>, but with <i>heirship</i>; and so
we are taught in Romans viii. "If children, then
heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, if so
be that <i>we suffer</i> with Him, that we may be also <i>glorified</i>
together." Again, we must, "through much
<i>tribulation</i>, enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts
xiv. 22). The Lord Jesus Himself, likewise, stands
as the great illustration of the principle upon which
we are dwelling. He occupied the place and enjoyed
the favor of a Son from before all worlds,
(Prov. viii.) yet ere He could lay His hand upon the
inheritance He must pass through suffering. He
had a baptism to be baptized with, and was straitened
(&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;) until it was accomplished. So
also when He remembered that "a corn of wheat
must fall into the ground and die," or else abide <i>alone</i>,
His soul was "<i>troubled</i>." Now, we are to "know
Him in the fellowship of His sufferings," before we
can know Him in the fellowship of His glory; hence
it is that the palmed multitude mentioned in Revelation
vii. had to pass through "great tribulation" (&#964;&#951;&#962; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#962; &#952;&#955;&#953;&#968;&#949;&#969;&#962;) ere they reached their peaceful,
heavenly home. Passages of Scripture might be
multiplied in proof of this point, but I will merely
refer to the following, viz.&mdash;Phil. i. 29; 1 Thess. iii.
4; 2 Thess. i. 5; 1 Tim. iv. 10; 2 Tim. ii. 12; 1
Peter v. 10.</p>

<p>But, in this remarkable vision, there are two points
which, as they appear prominently in the whole of
Israel's after history, deserve to be particularly noticed.
I allude to "the smoking furnace, and the
burning lamp." (ver. 17.) It has been well observed,
by a recent writer, that Israel's history might be
summed up in these two words, "the furnace and
the lamp." Egypt was a trying furnace to the seed
of Abraham. There the fire burned fiercely, but it
was soon followed by "the burning lamp" of God's
own deliverance. The cry of the suffering seed had
come up into the ears of Jehovah. He had heard
their groanings and seen their afflictions, and had
come down to display above their heads "the lamp"
of salvation. "I am come down to deliver them,"
said He to Moses. Satan might take delight in
kindling the furnace, and in adding to its intensity,
but the blessed God, on the other hand, ever delighted
in letting the rays of His lamp fall upon the
dark path of His suffering heirs. So, when Jehovah
had, in the faithfulness of His love, brought them
into the land of Canaan, they again and again,
kindled a furnace by their sins and iniquities; He,
as frequently, raised up deliverers in the persons of
the judges which were as so many lamps of deliverance
to them. Further, when by their aggravated
rebellion, they were plunged into the furnace kindled
at Babylon, even there we observe the glimmerings
of "the burning lamp," and finally it shone out for
their full deliverance, in the decree of Cyrus.</p>

<p>Now, the Lord was constantly reminding the children
of Israel of the above truth. He says to them,
"But the Lord hath taken you, and brought you
forth out of the <i>iron furnace</i>." (Deut. iv. 20; 1 Kings
viii. 51.) Again, "Cursed be the man that obeyeth
not the words of this covenant, which I commanded
your fathers, in the day that I brought them forth
out of the land of Egypt, from <i>the iron furnace</i>."
(Jer. xi. 3, 4.)</p>

<p>Finally, we may ask, are the seed of Abraham
now suffering in the furnace, or are they enjoying
the lamp of God?&mdash;for they must be experiencing
either the one or the other&mdash;the furnace, assuredly.
They are scattered over the face of the earth as a
proverb and a byword, a reproach and a hissing
among all the nations of the earth. Thus are they
in the iron furnace. But, as it has ever been, "the
burning lamp" will assuredly follow "the smoking
furnace," for "all Israel shall be saved; as it is
written, there shall come out of Sion <i>the Deliverer</i>,
and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob." (Isa.
lix. 20; Rom. xi. 26.)</p>

<p>Thus we see how that Israel's eventful history has
all along stood connected with the smoking furnace
and the burning lamp, here seen in vision by Abram.
They are either presented to us in the furnace of
affliction, through their own sin, or enjoying the
fruits of God's salvation; and even at this moment,
when, as has been already observed, they are manifestly
in the furnace, we can witness the fulfillment
of God's promise, so often repeated, "And unto his
son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may
have a <i>lamp</i> (margin) always before me in Jerusalem,
the city which I have chosen Me to put My
name there." (1 Kings xi. 36; xv. 14; 2 Kings viii.
19; Psalm cxxxii. 17.) If it be asked where does
this lamp shine now? Not on earth, for Jerusalem,
the place of its earthly display, is "trodden down of
the Gentiles," but the eye of faith can behold it shining
with undimmed lustre "in the true tabernacle,"
where it will continue to shine "until the fulness of
the Gentiles be come in;" and then, when the furnace,
seen in this chapter by Israel's great progenitor,
shall have been heated to the very highest degree
of intensity, when the blood of Israel's tribes shall
flow like water round the walls of Jerusalem, even
then, shall the blessed lamp come forth from the
place where it now shines, and cast its cheering rays
upon the dark path of the oppressed and sorrowing
remnant, bringing to mind those oft-illustrated
words, "<span class="smcap">O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself;
but in me is thy help</span>."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<h3>CHAPTERS XVI., XVII.</h3>

<p>These two chapters give us an account of Abram's
effort to obtain the promised seed by hearkening to
the voice of his wife, and also of God's mode of
teaching him the unprofitableness of such an appeal
to the mere energy of nature as that which his effort
involved.</p>

<p>At the very opening of Abram's course we find
his faith put to the test in the matter of the famine,
but here we find him tried in quite another way, a
way moreover, which involved a far higher exercise
of faith and spiritual power. "His own body now
dead and the deadness of Sarah's womb;" although,
in the main, "he considered them not," must have
acted upon his mind to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>Now, as in the case of the famine already alluded
to, Egypt was at hand, holding out a refuge from
anxiety as to present supply, so here, "<i>an Egyptian
maid</i>,"&mdash;one of those maid-servants, doubtless, which
Abram had gotten during his sojourn in that evil
place&mdash;was presented to him as a relief in the time
of anxiety touching the promised seed. "<i>Abram
hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</i>"</p>

<p>But why introduce the element of bondage into
his house? Why did not Abram's mind shrink from
the thought of "the bondwoman and her son" as
much as it had shrunk from the thought of "the
steward of his house?" Might not the question,
"Lord, what wilt thou give me," be asked in connection
with one as well as the other? Surely
it was as much opposed to the divine economy
to grant the inheritance to the seed of "<i>a bondwoman</i>,"
as to a "<i>servant</i>." In either case it would
be an allowance of the claims of nature, which cannot
be.</p>

<p>The principles involved in this act of Abram's are
fully laid open to us in the inspired commentary
given in the Epistle to the Galatians. There we
read, "Abram had two sons, the one by a bondmaid,
the other by a free woman. But he who was of the
bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the
free woman was by promise. Which things are an
allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one
from the Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,
which is Agar. For this Agar is Mount Sinai in
Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is,
and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem
which is above is free, which is the mother of us
all." (chap. iv. 22-26.)</p>

<p>The churches of Galatia had been led away from
the simplicity and liberty of Christ and had returned
to "<i>the flesh</i>." They were beginning to substitute
religious ceremonies for the energies of the Spirit of
Christ. Hence it is that the Apostle, in the course
of his reasoning with them on their unhappy movement,
refers to the matter recorded in our chapters,
and the way in which he expounds it to them renders
it unnecessary to dwell longer upon it. This
step of Abram's only "gendered to bondage;" it
introduced an unhealthy and an unhappy element
into his house which, as we shall see when we proceed
further with our subject, he had to expel ere he
could reach the highest point of elevation in his
course.</p>

<p>In chapter xvii. we have God's remedy presented
to us, and most consolatory it is to observe how the
Blessed One at once comes in in order to lead back
His servant to the <i>simple</i> yet <i>difficult</i> position of faith
in Himself&mdash;simple, because therein we have but
<i>one object</i> with which to be occupied&mdash;difficult, because
therein we have to contend against the workings
of "an evil heart of unbelief," leading us to
"depart from the living God."</p>

<p>"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine,
the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him, I
AM THE ALMIGHTY GOD; <i>walk before</i> <small>ME</small>, <i>and
be thou perfect</i>." Here was at once the effectual
cure for all impatient anxiety. "<i>I am Almighty</i>"&mdash;I
can quicken the dead&mdash;I can call those things that
be not as though they were&mdash;I can, if needs be, raise
up of stones, children unto you&mdash;no flesh shall glory
in My presence. "I am Almighty, walk before Me
and be thou perfect."</p>

<p>It is perhaps one of the finest principles with
which the mind can be occupied, that our God desires
that He may ever be learnt, in the variety of
His perfections, by the need of His people. We
have already met a striking illustration of this important
principle, in the matter of Abram's conflict
with the king of Sodom, in chapter xiv. There,
when Abram was tempted by the offers of the enemy,
he found relief in the apprehension of God's character
as "the Most High God, the possessor of heaven
and earth." The character of the communion into
which Melchizedek led the soul of Abram was
suited to the circumstances in which he stood.
So is it exactly in this 17th chapter. Communion
with God as "the Almighty" was the sole remedy
for impatient anxiety as to the fulfillment of any
promise.</p>

<p>Now, when once the Lord exhibits Himself in His
character of "Almighty," there can be no obstacle
whatsoever to the outflow of His grace; for, when
almighty power and almighty grace combine in behalf
of the sinner, faith may count upon a rich and
an abundant harvest.</p>

<p>The promises, therefore, with which this chapter
abounds are just such as we might have expected.
"I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make
nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
And I will establish my covenant between Me and
thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for
an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and
to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee,
and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art
a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
possession; and I will be their God." (xvii. 6-8.)
Surely these are promises which <i>almighty grace</i> alone
could utter, <i>almighty power</i> alone fulfill.</p>

<p>The above promises stand connected with "the
covenant of circumcision" which is specially important
as looked at in connection with Abram's effort to
obtain the seed otherwise than by the operations of
God's own hand. It would be profitable to dwell
for a little upon the doctrine of this covenant of
circumcision but my design in taking up this history,
is not by any means to handle it in a doctrinal
way, but rather to draw from it some of those valuable
principles of a decidedly practical tendency with
which it so richly abounds; and therefore I pass
rapidly over chapters xvi., xvii. which contain a
mine of precious doctrinal truth quite sufficient to
occupy a separate treatise.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Ere closing my observations on this section of our
narrative, I would add that it is <i>faith</i> alone which
can enable one to listen, as Abraham here does, to
the promises of Almighty God, and when faith listens,
God will surely continue to speak. Abram here
gets his name changed to Abraham, and the Lord
unfolds to him the future greatness and number of
his seed, while Abraham hearkens in the unquestioning
silence of faith. But when the "Almighty
God" goes on to say with reference to Sarai, "As
for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai,
but Sarah shall her name be. And I will bless her,
and give thee a son also of her; yea, I will bless
her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of
people shall be of her." (vers. 15, 16.) He is at
once overwhelmed by the pledges of such marvelous
power and grace to be exercised towards him. They
exceeded anything he had as yet known, and "Abraham
fell on his face." This is very instructive.
Abraham with his face in the dust, overcome by the
plenitude of almighty power and grace! Surely,
we may say, while dwelling upon such a scripture
as this, it is only <i>faith</i> that can rightly entertain the
"<i>Almighty God</i>," it <i>alone</i> can give Him His due and
proper place and honor Him as He should be honored.
When the Almighty displays Himself, <i>self</i>
must be excluded, hence we find that <i>Abram</i> is set
aside in all this&mdash;<i>Sarai</i> is lost sight of&mdash;"<i>the bondwoman
and her son</i>" are, for the moment, put far
out of view, and nothing is seen but "the Almighty
God" in the sovereignty and fulness of His grace
and power, and the faith that could lie prostrate
in the dust, in silent adoration of such a display of
the divine glories.</p>

<p>How different is this from the preceding chapter!
There we find Abram hearkening to the suggestion
of Sarai his wife, with regard to the bondwoman&mdash;here
we find him hearkening to the voice of Jehovah,
as Almighty, who is about to quicken the dead womb
of Sarah, and to call those things that be not as
though they were, that no flesh might glory in His
presence. There it is Abram and Sarai <i>without God</i>&mdash;here
it is God <i>without Abram and Sarai</i>. In a
word, there it is <i>flesh</i>&mdash;here it is spirit&mdash;there it is
<i>sight</i>&mdash;here it is <i>faith</i>. Wondrous contrast! Exactly
similar to that afterwards displayed by the Apostle
to the churches of Galatia, when he sought to restore
them from the sad influence of "the beggarly elements"
of the flesh and the world, to the full liberty
wherewith Christ had made them free.</p>


<h3>CHAPTERS XVIII., XIX.</h3>

<p>I class these two chapters together because, like
those we have just been considering, they furnish us
with a contrast&mdash;a contrast most marked and striking
between the position occupied by Abraham in
chapter xviii., and that occupied by Lot in chapter
xix.</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus when asked by Judas, not Iscariot,
"how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto
us and not unto the world?" replied, "If a man
love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father
will love him, and We will come unto him and make
our abode with him." (John xiv. 23.) Again, "Behold,
I stand at the door and knock: if any man
hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to
him, and will sup with him, and he with Me." (Rev.
iii. 20.) Now, Abraham furnishes us with an exceedingly
happy exemplification of the truth stated
in the above passages. "The Lord appeared unto
him in the plains of Mamre: and He sat in <i>the tent
door</i> in the heat of the day." (chap. xviii. 1.) Here
we find Abraham again in the full exhibition of his
stranger character. <i>Mamre</i> and <i>the tent</i> are associated
in our minds with the day of his triumph over
the king of Sodom. Abraham is still a stranger
and a pilgrim "dwelling in tabernacles." The revelation
made unto him by the Almighty God had
not altered the tone of his character in this respect,
but had rather imparted fresh vigor and energy
thereto. A simple dependence upon the promise of
the Almighty God was the most effectual means of
maintaining him in his stranger condition.</p>

<p>Now, it is, in the very highest degree, instructive
to see the honor here put upon the character and
condition of the stranger. Throughout the wide
range of the world there was just <i>one spot</i> in which
the Lord could accept the rites of hospitality and
make Himself at home, and that was in <i>the tent of</i>
"<i>a pilgrim and stranger</i>." The Lord would not honor
the sumptuous halls and princely palaces of Egypt
with His presence. No. All His sympathies and
all His affections hung around the stranger of Mamre,
who was the only one who, in the midst of an
evil world, could be induced to take God for his
portion.</p>

<p>What a season of enjoyment it must have been to
Abraham while those heavenly strangers sat with
him and partook of the offerings of his generous
heart. Mark how he calls forth into action all the
energies of his house to do honor to his guests. He
hastens from the tent to the field, and from the field
to the tent again, and seems to lose sight of himself
in his effort to make others happy.</p>

<p>Nor is it merely by partaking of Abraham's
hospitality that the Lord gives expression to the
high estimation in which He holds him; He renews
His promise to him with regard to the son&mdash;He
opens up His counsels to him with reference
to Sodom. "Shall I," says He, "hide from
Abraham that thing which I do; seeing that
Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be
blessed in him? <i>For I know him</i>, that he will
command his children and his household after
him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to
do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring
upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him."
(vers. 17-19.)</p>

<p>Here Abraham is seen as "<i>the friend of God</i>."
"The servant knoweth not what his lord doeth,"
but Abraham was made acquainted with what the
Lord was about to do to Sodom, while Lot&mdash;the
one who was so deeply interested in the solemn
event&mdash;was left in profound ignorance about it.</p>

<p>How then does Abraham make use of his favored
position? Does he use it to strengthen more fully,
and place on a firmer basis, the future interests of
his house? Surely the natural heart would at once
have prompted him to make such a use of his present
advantage in the matter of nearness to Jehovah.
Does he use it thus? Nay. Abraham had learnt
too much of the ways of God to act in a way savoring
so much of the selfishness of a heartless world.
But, even had he thought of such a thing, he had
no need to utter a syllable on the subject, for "<i>the
Almighty God</i>" had most amply satisfied his heart
with regard to the everlasting interests of his house&mdash;He
had fixed it upon such a foundation that an
anxious thought would have evidenced a complete
want of moral order in Abraham's soul. He therefore
entertained not a thought about himself or his
house, but like a genuine man of faith, <i>he takes advantage
of his place in the presence of God to intercede
for a brother, whose worldliness had plunged him into
the very midst of that place which was about to be given
over to everlasting destruction</i>. "And Abraham drew
near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous
with the wicked?" (ver. 23.) "<i>The righteous!</i>" to
whom can he allude? Can it be to the man who
had so deliberately turned aside out of the path of
faith to take up his abode at Sodom? Yes; he
speaks of Lot&mdash;he calls him "<i>righteous</i>,"&mdash;he speaks
of him in the very same terms as the Spirit in the
apostle afterward speaks of him when he calls him
a "righteous soul." Abraham, therefore, was taught
of God when he could recognize in the man surrounded
by all the pollution of Sodom "a righteous
soul."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>I doubt not it will be admitted by every one taught
of God that the conduct of Abraham in this chapter,
furnishes us with one of the most important results
of a holy and separated walk. We observe in it a
man pleading with God in a most urgent strain for
one who had turned his back upon him, and selected
Sodom as the place of his abode. How completely
must Abraham's soul have been lifted above "the
things that are seen" when he could thus forget
"the strife" and the departure, worldliness and evil
of Lot, and plead for him still as "a righteous soul."
If Abraham appears as "the <i>friend</i> of God" under
other circumstances and other scenes, surely he is
here seen as the <i>child</i> of God exhibiting most sweetly
those principles which he had learnt in communion
with his heavenly Father.</p>

<p>We shall now leave Abraham, for a little, enjoying
his happy place before the Lord, while we contemplate
the last sad scene in the life of one who
seems to have valued the things of this life more
highly than was consistent with the character of "a
stranger and pilgrim" or "a righteous soul."</p>

<p>From the time that the separation took place between
Abraham and Lot, the former seems to have
proceeded "from strength to strength;" while the
latter, on the contrary, seems to have proceeded
only downwards, from one stage of weakness to another,
until we find him, at the close, making shipwreck
of everything, and merely "escaping with his
life." The loss of all his goods in the battle between
the "four kings and five" does not seem to have
had any effect upon the mind of Lot in the way of
teaching him the evil of being mixed up with the
world; yea, he seems to have become more deeply
involved in worldliness after that event than he had
been before; for, at the first, he merely "pitched
his tent <i>towards</i> Sodom" (chap. xiii. 12); but now
we find him sitting "in the gate" (chap. xix. 1),
which, as we know, was then the place of honor.
When once a man has put his hand to the plow
if he begin to look back, we have been told by Him
who cannot err, that "he is not <i>fit</i> for the kingdom
of God." Nor is it possible to count upon the fearful
lengths to which a man may go when once the
world, in any one of its varied aspects, has taken
possession of his heart, or when once he has begun
to turn his back upon the people of God. The terrible
declension spoken of in Hebrews x., which
stops not short of "trampling under foot the Son of
God," has its beginning in the apparently simple
act of "forsaking the assembling of ourselves together."
How needful, therefore, it is that we
should take heed to our ways, and watch the avenues
of our hearts and minds, lest any evil thing should
get dominion over us, which, however trivial in itself,
might lead to the most appalling results.</p>

<p>Now, it strikes me, that we have in the circumstance
presented to us in the opening of chapter xix.
the full evidence of Lot's fallen condition. The
Lord Himself does not appear at all. He remains
at a distance from the unholy place, and merely
sends <i>His angels</i> to execute His commission upon
the devoted city of Sodom. The angels, too, exhibit
all the symptoms of distance and strangership&mdash;they
refuse to go into Lot's house when invited, saying,
"<i>Nay, but we will abide in the street all night</i>."
True, they subsequently enter into his house; but,
if they do so, it is not so much to enjoy refreshment
as to counteract the sad effects of Lot's wrong circumstances.
How different was the scene at Lot's
house from that which they had so lately witnessed
at the tent of the stranger of Mamre! The tumult
of the men of Sodom&mdash;to whom, notwithstanding all
their ungodly deeds and ungodly speeches, Lot applies
the title of "<i>brethren</i>"&mdash;the evident embarrassment
of Lot at being discovered in such painful
circumstances&mdash;the shocking proposal which he is
constrained to make in order to screen his guests
from the violence of the ungodly men of Sodom&mdash;the
struggle at the door, and Lot's danger&mdash;all these
things must have shocked the heavenly strangers,
and stood in marked contrast with the holy peace
and retirement of Abraham's tent, together with his
own calm and dignified demeanor throughout the
scene. Well might those angels have been astonished
to find "a righteous soul" in such a place,
when he could have enjoyed, in company with his
separated brother, the peaceful and holy joys of his
steady and consistent course.</p>

<p>But the time had now arrived for the pouring out
of the cup of divine wrath upon Sodom. "The
men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides?...
bring them out of <i>this place</i>: for we will destroy
this place, because the cry of them is waxen great
before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent
us to destroy it." (vers. 12, 13.) The critical moment
which the Lord Jesus, in the gospel, notes by
the exceedingly solemn word "UNTIL," was now
at hand for the careless inhabitants of Sodom, who
dreamed not of any interruption to their "eating,
and drinking, buying and selling, marrying and giving
in marriage." A moment's respite is allowed,
during which Lot bears a message to his son-in-law,
a testimony as to the rapidly approaching judgment;
but, ah! what power could the testimony of one who
had voluntarily come in and settled amongst them,
have upon those who had lived and moved from
their earliest infancy in the midst of the ungodly
scene? How could Lot expect that his <i>words</i> would
have any weight when his <i>ways</i> had so sadly contradicted
them? He might now, with terrified aspect
and earnest entreaties, urge them to leave a place
which he knew was doomed to everlasting destruction,
but they could not forget the calm and deliberate
way in which he had at first "pitched his tent toward
Sodom," and finally taken his seat "in the gate;"
hence, as might be expected, "he seemed as one
that mocked unto his sons-in-law." (ver. 14.) And
how, so far as he was concerned, could it be otherwise?
His sons-in-law might be, and doubtless
were, responsible before God for the rejection of the
testimony; but Lot could not, by any means, expect
them to heed him much, indeed, we find that even
he himself was tardy in departing from the place;
for "<i>while he lingered</i>"&mdash;while his heart still went
after some object or another that was dear to him&mdash;"the
men <i>laid hold upon his hand</i>, and upon the
hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two
daughters; the Lord being merciful to him, and
<i>they brought him forth</i> and set him without the city."
(ver. 16.) From this statement, it is manifest that,
had not the men "laid hold of, and brought forth"
Lot, he would, no doubt, have "lingered" on "<i>until</i>"
the fire of God's judgment had fallen upon him, and
prevented even his "escaping with his life." But
they "pulled him out of the fire," because "the
Lord had mercy upon him."</p>

<p>But this escape of Lot's only served to put fresh
honor upon Abraham, for we read that "when God
destroyed the cities of the plain, <i>he remembered Abraham
and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow</i>"
(ver. 29). Thus, as Abraham's sword had delivered
Lot in the time of the conquest of Sodom, his prayer
delivered him in the time of its final overthrow, "for
the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth
much." Nor does the contrast between those
two men stop here. There is yet another scene in
which they stand at a great distance from each other
as to the moral condition of their souls. "Abraham
gat him up early in the morning, to the place where
he stood before the Lord" (ver. 27). Here the man
of faith, the holy pilgrim, once more raises his head
amid the mighty scene of desolation. All was over
with Sodom and its guilty inhabitants, "the smoke
of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
Sad spectacle! The din and bustle of that once
stirring city was hushed; silence reigned around&mdash;the
buying and selling&mdash;the eating and drinking&mdash;the
marrying and giving in marriage&mdash;all the intercourse
of social life had been awfully broken in
upon. The solemn "<small>UNTIL</small>" had come at last&mdash;the
only one in all that wicked place who, notwithstanding
his failure, could be regarded as "the salt," had
been removed&mdash;the measure of Sodom's iniquity
had been filled up&mdash;the day of divine longsuffering
closed, and nothing now met the eye of Abraham
but misery and desolation throughout all the plain.
How melancholy! And yet it was but a type of the
far more terrible desolation which shall sweep across
this guilty world when the Son of man makes His
appearance, "when every eye shall see Him, and all
the tribes of the earth shall mourn and wail because
of Him."</p>

<p>Thus, "Abraham stood <i>before the Lord</i>," completely
exempt from all the sad effects of the recent
visitation, as far as he was personally concerned.
His stranger condition which, in the days of Chedorlaomer,
had enabled him to live outside of Sodom
and all its circumstances, still kept him free, and
was the means of his escape from Sodom's unutterable
woe and misery. Had Abraham, when solicited
by the King of Sodom, mixed himself up with the
things of Sodom, he would have been involved, in
some measure, as was his brother Lot, in its overthrow.
He himself would have been saved, but his
work would have been burnt up. But Abraham was
looking for "a city that hath foundations," and he
knew at once that Sodom was not that city, and
hence he would have nothing whatever to do with
it. He would "hate even the garment spotted by
the flesh"&mdash;he would "touch not the unclean thing,"
and now he was permitted to realize the blessed results
of his conduct, for, while Lot had to retreat in
confusion and sorrow to a cave in the mountains,
his wife and all his possessions being lost, Abraham
takes his stand, in all that blessed calmness and
dignity which ever characterized him, in the presence
of Jehovah, and from thence surveys the
heart-rending scene.</p>

<p>But what of Lot? How did he end his course?
"Oh, tell it not in Gath! publish it not in the streets
of Askelon!" Well may we desire to throw a veil
over the closing scene of the life of one who does
not seem to have ever realized, as he should, the
power of <i>the call of God</i>. He had always displayed
a secret desire for the things of Egypt or those of
Sodom. His heart does not seem to have been
thoroughly detached from the world, and therefore
his course was always unsteady; from the time he
separated himself from Abraham, he went from bad
to worse&mdash;from one stage of evil to another, until at
last the scene closes with the shocking transaction
in the cave; the sad results of which were seen in
the persons of Moab and Ammon, the enemies of
the people of God.</p>

<p>Thus ended the course of Lot, whose history
ought to be a solemn warning to all Christians who
feel a tendency to be carried away by the world.
The history has not been left on record without a
purpose. "Whatever things were written aforetime,
were written for our learning," may we therefore
learn from the above narrative, "not to lust after
evil things," for, although "the Lord knows how to
deliver the godly out of temptation," yet it is our
place to keep as much out of the way of temptation
as we can, and our prayer should ever be "lead us
not into temptation." "The world passeth away, and
the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God
abideth forever" (1 John ii. 17).</p>


<h3>CHAPTERS XX., XXI.</h3>

<p>Lot has now passed off the scene&mdash;his sun has
gone down amid thick clouds and a gloomy atmosphere;
it now remains for us to pursue, for a few
moments longer, the narrative of Abraham's ways,
and God's dealings with him.</p>

<p>There was one point involved in chapter xii.
which I left untouched, knowing that it would come
before us again in this place.</p>

<p>When Abraham went down into Egypt, he entered
into a compact with Sarah his wife <i>to conceal part of
the truth</i>, "Say, I pray thee," said he, "thou art my
sister" (Chap. xii. 13). One evil ever leads to another.
Abraham was moving in the wrong direction
when he went down into Egypt for help, and therefore
did not exhibit that refinement of conscience
which would have told him of the moral unsoundness
of this mental reservation. "Speak every man
truth with his neighbor," being a divine principle,
would always exercise an influence upon one walking
in communion with God; but Abraham's desire
to get out of present trial was an evidence of failure
in communion, and hence "his moral sense," as a
recent writer has termed it, was not as keen or as
elevated as it should have been. However, although
the Lord plagued Pharaoh's house because of his
having taken Sarah into it, and further, although
Pharaoh rebukes Abraham for his acting in the
matter, yet the latter says nothing whatever about
the deliberate compact into which he had entered
with his wife, to keep back part of the truth; he
silently takes the rebuke and goes on his way, but
the root of the evil remained still in his heart, ready
to show itself at any time if circumstances should
arise to draw it out.</p>

<p>Now, it is marvelous to behold Abraham coming
up out of Egypt&mdash;building an altar and pitching a
tent&mdash;exhibiting the noble generosity of faith&mdash;vanquishing
Chedorlaomer and repulsing the temptation
of the King of Sodom&mdash;urging his request for a son
and heir, receiving the most gracious answer&mdash;on
his face before God in the sense of His almighty
grace and power&mdash;entertaining the heavenly strangers
and interceding for his brother Lot. In a
word, I say, it is marvelous to behold Abraham
passing through such brilliant scenes, comprising
a series of years, and, all the while, this moral point,
in which he had erred at the very threshold of his
course, remains unsettled in his heart. True, it did
not develop itself during the period to which I have
just referred, but why did it not? Because Abraham
was not in circumstances to call it out, but there it
was notwithstanding. The evil was not <i>fully brought
out</i>&mdash;not confessed, not got rid of,&mdash;and the proof
of this is, that the moment he again finds himself in
circumstances which could act upon <i>his weak point</i>,
it is at once made manifest that the weak point is
there. The temptation through which he passed in
the matter of the King of Sodom, was not by any
means calculated to touch this peculiar point; nor
was anything that occurred to him from the time he
came up out of Egypt until he went down into Gerar,
calculated to touch it, for had it been touched, it
would no doubt have exhibited itself.</p>

<p>We never can know what is in our hearts until
circumstances arise to draw it out. Peter did not
imagine that he could deny his Lord, but when he
got into circumstances which were calculated to act
upon his peculiar weakness, he showed that the
weakness was there.</p>

<p>It required the protracted period of forty years in
the wilderness to teach the children of Israel "what
was in their hearts" (Deut. viii. 2); and it is one of
the grand results of the course of discipline through
which each child of God passes, to lead him into a
more profound knowledge of his own weakness and
nothingness. "We had the <i>sentence of death in ourselves</i>,
that we should not trust in ourselves, but in
God which raiseth the dead" (2 Cor. i. 9). The
more we are growing in the sense of our infirmities,
the more shall we see our need of clinging more
closely to Christ&mdash;drawing more largely upon His
grace, and entering more fully into the cleansing
virtue and value of His atoning blood. The Christian,
at the opening of his course, never knows his
own heart; indeed, he could not bear the full
knowledge of it; he would be overwhelmed thereby.
"The Lord leads us not by the way of the Philistines
lest we should see war," and so be plunged in despair.
But He graciously leads us by a circuitous
route, in order that our apprehension of His grace
may keep pace with our growing self-knowledge.</p>

<p>In chapter xx., then, we find Abraham again,
after the lapse of many years, falling into the old
error, a suppression of truth, for which he has to
suffer a rebuke from a mere man of the world. The
man of the world, in this scene, seemed, for the moment,
to possess a more refined moral sense than
the man of God. "Said he not unto me," says he,
"'She is my sister'! and she, even she herself said,
'He is my brother': in the integrity of my heart
and innocency of my hands have I done this." But
mark how God enters the scene for the purpose of
vindicating His servant. He says to Abimelech,
"Behold, thou art but a dead man." Yes, with all
"the integrity of his heart and innocency of his
hands"&mdash;with all his fine moral sense of right and
wrong, he was "but a dead man," when it came to
be a question, for one moment, between him and
even an erring child of God. God, in His grace,
was looking at His dear servant from quite a different
point of view from that adopted by Abimelech.
All that the latter could see in Abraham was a man
guilty of a manifest piece of deception, but God saw
more than that, and therefore He says to Abimelech,
"Now therefore restore the man his wife; <i>for he is
a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt
live</i>." What dignity is here put upon Abraham!
God himself vindicates him before the world! Not
a syllable of reproof!&mdash;not a breath of disapprobation!&mdash;no,
"he is a prophet and he shall pray for
thee and thou shalt live." How truly consolatory
it is for the poor, weak, and harassed believer to
remember that His Father is ever viewing him
through the medium of the Lord Jesus Christ. He
sees nothing whatever upon His child but the excellency
and perfectness of Jesus. Thus, while a
man of the world may have to rebuke a child of
God, as in the case before us, God declares that He
values that character which the believer has received
from Him more than all the amiability, integrity, and
innocency that nature can boast of.</p>

<p>This reminds us of the way in which the Lord
vindicates the Baptist before the multitude, although
He had sent a message to himself which must have
exercised him deeply;&mdash;"I say unto you, among
those that are born of women there is not a greater
prophet than John the Baptist" (Luke vii. 28).
Thus, whatever unfavorable aspect the child of God
may wear in the world's view, God will ever show
Himself the vindicator of such. "He suffered no
man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved kings for
their sakes, saying, Touch not mine anointed and
do my prophets no harm" (1 Chron. xvi. 21, 22).</p>

<p>However, as was observed with regard to John
the Baptist, the message sent from the Lord to His
servant must have exercised his spirit deeply in
secret, so is it in Abraham's case. Abraham must
have felt deeply humbled in his soul at the thought
of what had occurred, and the consciousness of the
fact that God would not enter into judgment with
him about it would have augmented that feeling.
When Abraham fell into the same error in Egypt
we do not find that Pharaoh's reproof produced any
manifest effect. He was not humbled by it to such
a degree as to make a full confession of the whole
thing. He takes his departure out of Egypt, but
<i>the root</i> of evil remains in his heart, ready to shoot
forth its pernicious branches again. Not so in
chapter xx.; here we get at once at the root of the
matter&mdash;Abraham opens up his whole heart, he confesses
that from the very first moment of his course
he had retained this thing in his heart which had
twice betrayed him into an act, which, to say the
least of it, would not bear the light. And as there
is the full confession of the evil on his part, so is
there the complete renunciation of it&mdash;he gets rid of
it fully, root and branch. The leaven is put forth
out of every corner of his heart, he hearkens to
Abimelech's reproof and profits by it; it was God's
instrument by which He brought out the matter,
and delivered the soul of his servant from the power
of evil.</p>

<p>But, in addition to the point upon which we have
been dwelling, there was yet another question to be
settled ere Abraham could reach the most elevated
point of his course as a man of faith. The bondwoman
and her son were yet in the house. He
must put forth these from <i>his house</i> as he had put
forth the evil from <i>his heart</i>. The house and the
heart must be cleared out. In chapter xxi. we find
matters brought to a crisis with regard to the bondwoman
and her son, concerning whom we have
heard comparatively nothing until now. The element
of bondage had heretofore lain dormant in
Abraham's house because not roused into action, by
anything of an opposite nature and tendency. But,
in the birth of Isaac&mdash;the son of the free woman&mdash;the
child of promise&mdash;we see a new element introduced.
The spirit of liberty and the spirit of bondage
are thus brought into contact, and the struggle
must issue in the expulsion of either one or the
other. They cannot move on in harmony, for
"how can two walk together except they be agreed."</p>

<p>Now we are invited by the Apostle, in his epistle
to the Galatians, to behold in these two children,
"the two covenants," the one gendering to <i>bondage</i>,
the other to <i>liberty</i>; and further, to behold in them
samples of the fleshly and spiritual seed of Abraham,
the former, "born after the flesh," the latter, "born
after the Spirit." Nor can anything be more marked
than the line of demarcation between, not only the
two covenants, but the two seeds. They are totally
distinct the one from the other, and can never, by
any operation, be brought to coalesce. Abraham
was made to feel, and that painfully, this fact.
"Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the
son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my
son, even with Isaac" (Chap. xxi. 10). Here the
natural result shows itself. The two elements
could not mingle. As well might the north and
the south winds be expected to blow in all their
strength without exciting a convulsion in the
elements.</p>

<p>But it was most painful work to Abraham to be
obliged thus to thrust forth his son. "The thing
was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
his son;" but it mattered not, he must be put out,
for the son of a bondwoman could never inherit the
promises made only to the spiritual seed. If Ishmael
were to have been retained, it would have been an
open allowance of the claims of the flesh. Abraham
would have found something "as pertaining to the
flesh" and would thus have had "whereof to glory."
But no&mdash;all God's promises are to be made good to
those who, like Isaac, are the children of promise,
born after the Spirit, "not of blood, not of the will
of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God"
(John i. 13). Ishmael was manifestly born "of the
will of the flesh, and of the will of man," and "flesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God."
The flesh must therefore be set aside and kept under,
no matter how "grievous" it may be to our
hearts. The Christian will often find it grievous
enough to keep down the old principle which ever
lusts against the new, but the Lord gives spiritual
power for the struggle so that "we are more than
conquerors through Him that loves us."</p>

<p>But I must again remind the reader that it is not
my present purpose to pursue the doctrinal matter
involved in this instructive history<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; were I to do so
it would carry me far beyond the limits I have prescribed
for myself in this little paper, the design of
which is, as before observed, simply to direct attention
to a few leading principles put forward in the
narrative. I will therefore pass on to the next
chapter which is the last of the section laid out for
consideration.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p>The circumstances through which Abraham
passed in chapters twenty and twenty-one were
most important indeed. An evil which had long
been harbored in his heart had been put away; the
bondwoman and her son, who had so long retained
quiet possession of his house, were cast out, and he
now stands forth as "a vessel sanctified and meet
for the master's use, prepared unto every good
work."</p>

<p>"And it came to pass <i>after these things</i>, that God
did tempt (or try) Abraham." Here Abraham is at
once introduced into a place of real dignity and
honor. When God tries an individual it is a certain
evidence of His confidence in him. We never
read that "God did tempt Lot"&mdash;no, the goods of
Sodom furnished a sufficiently strong temptation for
Lot. The enemy laid a snare for him in the well-watered
plains of Sodom which he seemed but too
prone to fall into. Not so with Abraham. He
lived more in the presence of God, and was, therefore,
less susceptible of the influence of that which
had ensnared his erring brother.</p>

<p>Now, the test to which God submits Abraham&mdash;the
furnace in which He tries him, marks at once a
pure and genuine metal. Had Abraham's faith not
been of the purest and most genuine character, he
would assuredly have winced under the fiery ordeal
through which we behold him passing in this beautiful
chapter. When God promised Abraham a son,
he believed the promise "and it was counted unto
him for righteousness." "He staggered not at the
promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in
faith, giving glory to God." But then, having received
this son, having realized the truth of the promise,
was there not a danger that he would rest in
<i>the gift</i> instead of in <i>the Giver</i>? Was there not a
danger that he would lean upon Isaac, in thinking
upon the future seed and future inheritance, rather
than upon God Himself who had promised him the
seed? Surely there was, and God knew that, and
therefore tries His servant in a way, more than anything,
calculated to put him to the test as to the
object on which his soul was resting. The grand
inquiry put to Abraham's heart, in this wondrous
transaction, was, "are you still walking before <span class="smcap">the
Almighty God, the quickener of the dead</span>?"
God desired to know whether he could apprehend
in Him the One who was as able to raise up children
from the ashes of his sacrificed son as from the
dead womb of Sarah. In other words, God desired
to prove that Abraham's faith reached forth, as
some one has observed, <small>TO RESURRECTION</small>, for if it
stopped short of this, he never would have responded
to the startling command, "Take now, thy son,
thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest, and get thee
into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a
burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I
will tell thee of" (Chap. xxii. 2.) But Abraham
"staggered not." He at once responds to the call.
God had asked for Isaac, and Isaac must be given,
and that too without a breath of murmur. He could
give up anything or everything so long as his eye
rested upon "the Almighty God." And mark the
point of view in which Abraham puts this journey
of his to Mount Moriah, "I and the lad will go
yonder <i>and worship</i>." Yes, it was an act of worship,
for he was about to lay upon the altar of the
Quickener of the dead the one in whom all God's
promises centred. It was an act of worship&mdash;most
elevated worship, for he was about to prove, in the
sight of heaven and hell, that no other object filled
his soul but the Almighty God. Hence, what calmness!
what self-possession! what pure devotion!
what elevation of mind! what self-renunciation!
He never falters throughout the scene. He saddles
the ass, prepares the wood, and sets off to Mount
Moriah, without giving expression to one anxious
thought, although, as far as human eye could see,
he was about to lose the object of his heart's most
tender affection, yea, the one upon whom the future
interests of his house, to all appearance, depended.</p>

<p>Abraham, however, showed most fully that his
heart had found a nearer and dearer object than
Isaac, dear as he was; he showed also that his faith
was resting upon another object altogether, with reference
to the future interests of his seed, <i>and that
he was as simply resting upon the promise of Almighty
God after the birth of Isaac as before it</i>.</p>

<p>Behold, then, this man of faith as he ascends the
mount, taking with him his "well-beloved!" What
a scene of breathless interest!<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> How must the
angelic hosts have watched this illustrious father
from stage to stage of his wondrous journey, until
at last they beheld his hand stretched forth for the
knife to slay his son&mdash;that son for which he had so
long and ardently wished, and for which he had so
steadily trusted God. Then again, what an opportunity
for Satan to ply his fiery darts! What
abundant room for such suggestions as the following,
viz., "What will become of the promises of
God with regard to the seed and the inheritance, if
you thus sacrifice your only son? Beware that you
are not led astray by some false revelation; or, <i>if it
be true</i> that God has said so and so, doth not God
know that, in the day you sacrifice your son, all
your hopes will be blasted? Further, think of
Sarah; what will she do if she lose Isaac, after
having induced you to expel from your house Ishmael?"
All these suggestions, and many beside,
the enemy might bring to bear upon the heart of
Abraham. Nor would Abraham himself have been
beyond the region of those thoughts and reasonings
which, at such a time, would not fail to arise
within him. What then was his answer to all such
dark suggestions? RESURRECTION! "By faith
Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and
he that had received the promises offered up his
only begotten son, of whom it was said, that in Isaac
shall thy seed be called: <span class="smcap">accounting that God
was able to raise him up, even from the dead;
from whence also he received him in a figure</span>"
(Heb. xi. 17-19).</p>

<p>Resurrection is God's mighty remedy for all the
mischief and ruin introduced by Satan; when once
we arrive at this point, we have done with the power
of Satan, the last exercise of which is seen in death.
Satan cannot touch the life that has been received
in resurrection, for the last exercise of his power is
seen in the grave of Christ; beyond that he can do
nothing. Hence the security of the Church's place;
her "life is hidden with Christ in God." Blessed
hiding place! May we rejoice in it more and more
each day.</p>

<p>I will now draw this paper to a close. We have
followed Abraham in his course, from Ur of the
Chaldees up to the Mount Moriah&mdash;we have seen
him resign, at the call of God, family and kindred,
lands and possessions, worldly ease and prosperity;
and lastly, we have seen him, in the power of faith,
at the same call of God, ascend the solitary mount,
for the purpose of laying "his only begotten" upon
God's altar, and thus to declare that he could give
up everything and every one but God Himself&mdash;and
that, being acquainted with the meaning of
"<span class="smcap">the Almighty</span>" and "<span class="smcap">Resurrection</span>," he cared
not though he were called to look to the stones for
the raising up of seed unto him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have followed Lot from
Ur of the Chaldees also; but alas! his path was a
far different one from that of his brother. He does
not seem to have realized the power of the call of
God in his own soul; he moved rather under Abraham's
influence than under that of Jehovah; hence
we find that, while Abraham was, at every step of
his journey, letting go the world, Lot was doing the
very reverse; he was grasping at the world in every
shape and form, and he obtained that at which he
was grasping, but what then? What of the end?
Ah, that is the point. What of Lot's end? Instead
of being a noble spectacle unto angels, and a pattern
to all future generations of the faithful,&mdash;of
what faith can enable a man "to do and to suffer" for
God,&mdash;he was just the reverse; he was led away by
the enemy of his soul, who ensnared him by means
of the things of the world; he spent his days amid
the uncleanness of Sodom, and the scene closes with
the sad circumstances in the cave. All he did for
God or his people was to beget the Ammonite and
the Moabite, the enemies of both.</p>

<p>How wondrous then is that grace, which, speaking
of the history of such an one, could say, "And delivered
just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of
the wicked; for that righteous man dwelling among
them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous
soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds"
(2 Peter ii. 7, 8).</p>

<h2>"THOU AND THY HOUSE."</h2>


<p>There are two houses which occupy a very prominent
place on the page of inspiration, and
these are, the house of God and the house of God's
servant. God attaches immense importance to His
house; and justly so, because it is His. His truth,
His honor, His character, His glory, are all involved
in the character of His house; and hence it is His
desire that the impress of what He is should plainly
appear on that which belongs to Him. If God has
a house, it assuredly should be a godly house, a
holy house, a spiritual house, an elevated house, a
pure and heavenly house. It should be all this, not
merely in abstract position and principle, but practically
and characteristically. Its abstract position
is founded upon what God has made it, and where
He has set it; but its practical character is founded
upon the actual walk of those who form its constituent
parts down here upon this earth.</p>

<p>Now, while many minds may be prepared to enter
into the truth and importance of all the principles
connected with God's house, there may be but few,
comparatively, who are disposed to give a due
measure of attention to those connected with the
house of God's servant; although if one were asked
the question, What house stands next in order to
the house of God? he should undoubtedly reply,
The house of His servant. However, as there is
nothing like bringing the holy authority of God's
Word to bear upon the conscience, I shall quote a
few passages of Scripture, which will tend to show,
in a clear and forcible point of view, what are God's
thoughts about the house of one holding connection
with Him.</p>

<p>When the iniquity of the antediluvian world had
risen to a head, and the end of all flesh had come
before a righteous God, who was about to roll the
heavy tide of judgment over the corrupted scene,
these sweet words fell upon Noah's ear: "Come thou
and <i>all thy house</i> into the ark; for thee have I seen
righteous before Me in this generation." (Gen. vii. 1.)
Now, it will be said that Noah was a type of Christ&mdash;the
righteous head of a saved family&mdash;saved in
virtue of their association with him. All this is
fully granted; but Noah's typical character does not
in any wise interfere with the principle which I seek
to deduce from this and kindred passages, which
principle I shall here, at the outset, distinctly lay
down&mdash;it is this: <i>the house of every servant of God
is, in virtue of its connection with Him, brought into
a position of privilege and consequent responsibility</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
That this is a principle involving vast practical consequences
we shall, with God's blessing and grace,
see ere we close this paper; but we must first seek
to establish its truth from the Word of God. Were
we merely left to argue from analogy, our thesis
might be easily proved; for it could never be supposed,
by any mind at all acquainted with the character
and ways of God, that He would attach such
unspeakable importance to His own house, and
attach none at all, or almost none, to that of His
servant. This were impossible; it would be utterly
unlike God, and God must always act like Himself.
But we are not left to analogy on this most important
and deeply practical question; and the passage just
quoted forms one of the first of a series of direct
and positive proofs. In it we find those immensely
significant words, "<i>Thou and thy house</i>" inseparably
linked together. God did not reveal a salvation for
Noah which was of no avail to Noah's house. He
never contemplated such a thing. The same ark
that lay open to him lay open to them also. Why?
Was it because they had faith? No; but because
<i>he</i> had, and they were connected with him. God
gave him a blank check for himself and his family,
and it devolved upon him to fill it up by bringing
them in along with him. I repeat it, this does not
in the least interfere with Noah's typical character.
I look at him typically, but I look at him personally
also. Nor can I, under any circumstances, separate
a man from his house. The house of God is brought
into blessing and responsibility because of its connection
with Him; and the house of the servant of
God is brought into blessing and responsibility because
of its connection with him. This is our thesis.</p>

<p>The next passage to which I shall refer occurs in
the life of Abraham. "And the Lord said, 'Shall
I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?...
For I know him, that he will command his children
and his household after him, and they shall keep the
way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that
the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He
hath spoken of him.'" (Gen. xviii. 17-19.) Here it
is not a question of salvation, but of communion
with the mind and purposes of God; and let the
Christian parent note and solemnly ponder the fact
that when God was seeking out a man to whom He
could disclose His secret counsels, He selected one
possessing the simple characteristic of "commanding
his children and his household." This, to a
tender conscience, cannot fail to prove a most pungent
principle. If there is one point above another
in which Christians have failed, it is in this very
point of commanding their children and household.
They surely have not set God before them in this
particular; for if I look at the entire record of God's
dealings with His house, I find them invariably characterized
by the exercise of power on the principle
of righteousness. He has firmly established and
unflinchingly carried out His holy authority. It
matters not what the outward aspect or character
of His house may be, the essential principle of His
dealing with it is immutable. "Thy testimonies are
very sure; holiness becometh thy house, O Lord,
<i>forever</i>." Now, the servant must ever take his
Master as his model; and if God rules His house
with power exercised in righteousness, so must I;
for if I am in any one particular of my conduct different
from Him, I must in that particular be wrong.
This is plain.</p>

<p>But not only does God so rule His house; He likewise
loves, approves of, and treats with His marked
and honored confidence those who do the same. In
the above passage, we find Him saying, "I cannot
hide my purposes from Abraham." Why? Is it
because of his personal grace or faith? No; but
simply because "he will command his children and
his household." A man who knows how to command
his house is worthy of God's confidence. This is a
stupendous truth, the edge of which should pierce the
conscience of many a Christian parent. Many of us,
alas! with our eye resting on Genesis xviii. 19, may
well prostrate ourselves before the One who uttered
and penned that word, and cry out, Failure! failure!
shameful, humiliating failure! And why is this?
Why have we failed to meet the solemn responsibility
devolving upon us in reference to the due command
of our households? I believe there is but one reply,
viz., because we have failed to realize, by faith, the
privilege conferred upon those households in virtue
of their association with us. It is remarkable that
our two earliest proofs should present to our view,
with such accuracy, the two grand divisions of our
question, namely, privilege and responsibility. In
Noah's case, the word was, "Thou and thy house"
in the place of salvation; in Abraham's case, it was
"Thou and thy house" in the place of moral government.
The connection is at once marked and
beautiful, and the man who fails in faith to appropriate
the privilege will fail in moral power to answer
the responsibility. God looks upon a man's house
as part of himself, and he cannot, in the smallest
degree, whether in principle or practice, disregard
the connection without suffering serious damage,
and also marring the testimony.</p>

<p>Now, the question for the Christian parent's conscience
really is, <i>Am I counting upon God for my
house, and ruling my house for God?</i> A solemn
question, surely; yet it is to be feared very few feel
its magnitude and power. And here, perhaps, my
reader may feel disposed to demand fuller Scripture-proof
than has yet been adduced, as to our warrant
for counting upon God for our houses. I shall
therefore proceed with the Scripture-quotations. I
give one from the history of Jacob. "And God
said to Jacob, 'Arise, go up to Bethel.'" This
would seem to have been addressed to Jacob personally;
but he never thought for a moment of disconnecting
himself from his family, either as to
privilege or responsibility; wherefore it is immediately
added, "Jacob said unto <i>his household</i>, and
to all that were with him, 'Put away the strange
gods that are among you, and be clean, and change
your garments; and let <i>us</i> arise, and go up to
Bethel.'" (Gen. xxxv. 1-3.) Here we see that a
call to Jacob put Jacob's house under responsibility.
He was called to go up to God's house, and the
question immediately suggested itself to his conscience,
whether his own house were in a fit condition
to respond to such a call.</p>

<p>We now turn to the opening chapters of the book
of Exodus, where we find that one of Pharaoh's four
objections to the full deliverance and separation of
Israel had specific reference to "the little ones."
"And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto
Pharaoh; and he said unto them, 'Go, serve the
Lord your God; but who are they that shall go?'
And Moses said, 'We will go with our young and
with our old, with our sons and with our daughters,
with our flocks and with our herds will we go; <i>for</i>
we must hold a feast unto the Lord.'" (Ex. x. 8, 9.)
The reason why they should take the little ones and
all with them was because they were going to hold
a feast unto the Lord. Nature might say, Oh, what
can these little creatures know about a feast unto
the Lord? Are you not afraid of making them
formalists? The reply of Moses is simple and decisive&mdash;"We
will go with our young ... <i>for</i> we
must hold a feast unto the Lord." They had no
idea of seeking one thing for themselves and another
for their children. They dreamed not of Canaan
for themselves and Egypt for their children. How
could they taste the manna of the wilderness, or the
old corn of the land, while their children were feeding
upon the leeks, the onions, and the garlic of
Egypt? Impossible. Moses and Aaron understood
not such acting. They felt that God's call to them
was a call to their little ones; and, moreover, were
it not fully carried out, they would no sooner have
gone forth from Egypt by one road than their children
would draw them back by another. That such
would have been the case Satan was but too well
aware, and hence appears the reason of the objection,
"Not so: go now <i>ye that are men</i>." This is
the very thing which so many professing Christians
are doing (or attempting, rather, to do) at this
present time. They profess to go forth themselves
to serve the Lord, but their little ones are in Egypt.
They profess to have taken "three days' journey
into the wilderness;" in other words, they profess
to have left the world, they profess to be dead to it,
and risen with Christ, as the possessors of a heavenly
life, and the heirs and expectants of a heavenly
glory; but they leave their little ones behind, in the
hands of Pharaoh, or rather of Satan.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> They have
given up the world for themselves, but they cannot
do so for their children. Hence, on Lord's day,
the professed position of strangers and pilgrims is
taken; hymns are sung, prayers uttered, and principles
taught which bespeak a people far advanced
in the heavenly life, and just on the borders of
Canaan, in actual experience (in spirit, of course,
they are already there); but, alas! on Monday
morning, every habit, every pursuit, every object,
contradicts all this. The little ones are trained for
the world. The scope, aim, object, and entire character
of their education is worldly, in the truest and
strictest sense of the word. Moses and Aaron would
not have understood such actings, and neither indeed
should any morally honest heart, or upright mind,
understand them. I should have no other principle,
portion, or prospect for my children but what I
have for myself; nor should I train them with a view
to any other. If Christ and heavenly glory are
sufficient for me, they are sufficient for them likewise;
but then the proof that they are really sufficient
for me should be unequivocal. The tone of
the parent's character should be such as to afford not
a shadow of a doubt as to the real, deep-seated
purpose and object of his soul.</p>

<p>But what shall my child say to me if I tell him that
I am earnestly seeking Christ and heaven for him,
while at the same time I am educating him for the
world? Which will he believe? Which will exert
the more powerful practical influence on his heart
and life&mdash;my words, or my acts? Let conscience
reply; and oh, let it be an honest reply, a reply emanating
from its deepest depths, a reply which will
unanswerably demonstrate that the question is understood
in all its pungency and power. I verily
believe the time is come for plain dealing with one
another's conscience. It must be apparent to every
prayerful and attentive observer of the Christianity
of the present day, that it wears a most sickly aspect;
that the tone is miserably low; and, in a word,
that there must be something radically wrong. As
to testimony for the Son of God, it is rarely&mdash;alas!
how rarely!&mdash;thought of. Personal salvation seems
to form the very highest object with ninty-nine out
of every hundred professing Christians, as if we
were left here to be saved; and not, as saved ones,
to glorify Christ.</p>

<p>Now, I would affectionately, yet faithfully, suggest
the question, whether much of the failure in
practical testimony for Christ is not justly traceable
to the neglect of the principle involved in the expression,
"Thou and thy house." I cannot but
think it has much to do with it. One thing is certain,
that a quantity of worldliness, confusion, and
moral evil has crept in amongst us through our
little ones having been left in Egypt. We see
many who, it may be, ten, fifteen, or twenty years
ago, took a prominent place in testimony and service,
and seemed to have their hearts much in the work,
are now gone back, lamentably, not having power
to keep their own heads above water, much less
to help any one else. All this utters a warning
voice for Christian parents having rising families;
and the utterance is, "<span class="smcap">Beware of leaving your
little ones in Egypt</span>." Many a heart-broken
father, at the present moment, is left to weep and
groan over his fatal mistake in reference to his
household. He left them in Egypt, in an evil hour,
and under a gross delusion, and now when he ventures,
it may be in real faithfulness and earnest
affection, to drop a word into the ear of those who
have grown up around him, they meet it with a deaf
ear and an indifferent heart, while they cling with
vigor and decision to that Egypt in which he faithlessly
and inconsistently left them. This is a stern
fact, the statement of which may send a pang to
many a heart; but truth must be told, in order that,
though it wounds some, it may prove a salutary
warning to others. But I must proceed with the
proofs.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In the book of Numbers, "the little ones" are
again introduced to our notice. We have just seen
that the real purpose of a soul in communion with
God was to go up with the little ones out of Egypt.
They must be brought forth from thence at all cost;
but neither faith nor faithfulness will rest here. We
must not only count upon God to bring them up out
of Egypt, but also to bring them on into Canaan.
Here Israel signally failed. After the return of the
spies, the congregation, on hearing their discouraging
report, gave utterance to these fatal accents,
"Wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land,
to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children
should be a prey? Were it not better for us to return
into Egypt?" (Numb. xiv.) This was terrible.
It was, in reality, so far as in them lay, verifying
Pharaoh's wily prediction in reference to these very
little ones, "Look to it now, for evil is before you."
Unbelief always justifies Satan and makes God a liar,
while faith always justifies God and proves Satan
a liar; and as it is invariably true that according
to your faith so shall it be unto you, so we find, on
the other hand, that unbelief reaps as it sows. Thus
it was with unhappy, because unbelieving, Israel.
"As truly as I live, saith the Lord, <i>as ye have spoken
in Mine ears, so will I do to you</i>. Your carcasses
shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered
of you, according to your whole number,
from twenty years old and upward, which have
murmured against Me, doubtless ye shall not come
into the land concerning which I sware to make you
dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
and Joshua the son of Nun. <i>But your little ones</i>,
which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring
in, and they shall know the land which ye have
despised. But as for you, your carcasses, they
shall fall in the wilderness." (Ver. 28-32.) "They
limited the Holy One of Israel" as to their little
ones. This was a grievous sin, and it has been
recorded for our admonition. How constantly does
the heart of the Christian parent reason, in reference
to the mode of dealing with children, instead
of simply taking God's ground about them. It
may be said, We cannot make Christians of our
children. This is not the question. We are not
called to "make" any thing of them. This is God's
work, and His only; but if He says, "Bring your
little ones with you," shall we refuse? I would not
make a formalist of my child, and I <i>could</i> not make
him a real Christian; but if God, in infinite grace,
says to me, "I look upon your house as part of
yourself, and, in blessing you, I bless it," shall I,
in gross unbelief of heart, refuse this blessing, lest
I should minister to formalism, or because I cannot
impart reality? God forbid. Yea, rather, let me
rejoice, with deep unfeigned joy, that God has blessed
me with a blessing so divinely rich and full that it
extends not only to me, but also to all who belong
to me; and, seeing that grace has given me the
blessing, let faith take it up and appropriate it.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>But let us remember that the way to prove our
entrance into the blessing is by fulfilling the responsibility.
To say that I am counting upon God to
bring my children to Canaan, and yet all the while
educating them for Egypt, is a deadly delusion. My
conduct proves my profession to be a lie, and I am
not to wonder if, in the righteous dealings of God,
I am allowed to be filled with the fruit of my own
doings. Conduct will ever prove the reality of our
convictions; and in this, as in every thing else, that
word of the Lord is most solemnly true, "If any
man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine."
We often want to know the doctrine before we do
the will, and the consequence is, we are left in the
most profound ignorance. Now, to do the will of
God in reference to our children, is to treat them as
He does, by regarding them as part of ourselves,
and training them accordingly. It is not merely by
hoping they may ultimately prove to be the children
of God, but by regarding them as those who are
already brought into a place of privilege, and dealing
with them upon this ground in reference to
every thing. According to the thoughts and actings
of many parents, it would seem as though they regarded
their children in the light of heathens, who
had no present interest in Christ, or relationship to
God at all. This is, assuredly, falling grievously
short of the divine mark. Nor is this a question,
as it is too often made, of infant or adult baptism.
No; it is simply and entirely a question of faith in
the power and extent of that peculiarly gracious
word. "Thou and thy house"&mdash;a word the force
and beauty of which we shall see more and more
fully as we proceed.</p>

<p>Throughout the book of Deuteronomy, the children
of Israel are again and again instructed to set
the commandments, the statutes, the judgments,
and precepts of the law before their little ones; and
these same little ones are contemplated as inquiring
into the nature and object of various ordinances and
institutions. The reader can easily run through the
various passages.</p>

<p>I now pass on to that truly memorable resolution
of Joshua, "Choose you this day whom ye will
serve . . . . but as for me and my house, we will
serve the Lord." (Josh. xxiv. 15.) Observe, "Me
and my house." He felt it was not sufficient that
he himself should be personally pure from all contact
with the defilements and abominations of idolatry;
he had also to look well to the moral character
and practical condition of his house. Though
Joshua were not to worship idols, yet if his children
did so, would he be guiltless? Certainly not. Moreover,
the testimony of the truth would have been as
effectually marred by the idolatry of Joshua's house
as by the idolatry of Joshua himself; and judgment
would have been executed accordingly. It is well
to see this distinctly. The opening of the first book
of Samuel affords most solemn demonstration of the
truth of this&mdash;"And the Lord said to Samuel, 'Behold,
I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the
ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. In
that day I will perform against Eli all things which
I have spoken concerning <i>his house</i>: when I begin,
I will also make an end. For I have told him that
I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which
he knoweth; <small>BECAUSE HIS SONS MADE THEMSELVES
VILE AND HE RESTRAINED THEM NOT</small>.'" (1 Sam. iii.
11-13.)</p>

<p>Here we see that no matter what the personal
character of the servant of God may be, yet if he
fail in the due regulation of his house, God will not
hold him guiltless. Eli should have restrained his
sons. It was his privilege, as it is ours, to be able
to count upon the specific power of God in the subjugation
of every element in his house which was
calculated to mar the testimony; but he did not do
this, and hence his terrible end was that he broke
his neck about the house of God, because he had
not broken his heart about his own house. Had he
waited upon God about his willful sons&mdash;had he
acted faithfully&mdash;had he discharged the holy responsibilities
devolving upon him, the house of God
would never have been desecrated, and the ark of
God would not have been taken. In a word, had he
treated his house as part of himself, and made it
what it ought to be, he would not have called down
upon himself the heavy judgment of Him whose
principle it is never to separate the words, "<i>Thou
and thy house</i>."</p>

<p>But how many parents have since trodden in Eli's
footsteps! Through an utterly false idea in reference
to the entire basis and character of parental relationship,
they have allowed their children, from
infancy to boyhood, and from boyhood to manhood,
in the unrestrained indulgence of the will. Not
having faith to take divine ground, they have failed
in moral power to take even the human ground of
making their children respect and obey them, and
the issue has presented to view the most fearful
picture of lawless extravagance and wild confusion.
The highest object for the servant of God to set before
him in the management of his house is the
testimony therein afforded to the honor of Him to
whose house he himself belongs. This is really the
proper ground of action. I must not seek to have
my children in order because it would be an annoyance
and inconvenience to <i>me</i> to have them otherwise,
but because the honor of God is concerned in
the godly order of the households of all those who
form constituent parts of His house.</p>

<p>Here, however, it may be objected that up to this
point we have been breathing only the atmosphere
of Old-Testament scripture, and that the principles
and proofs have been only thence deduced; now, on
the contrary, God's principle of action is grace according
to election, and this leads to the calling out
of a man, irrespective of all domestic ties and relationships,
so that you may find a godly, devoted,
heavenly-minded saint at the head of a most ungodly,
irregular, worldly family. I maintain, in opposition
to this, that the principles of God's moral
government are eternal, and therefore, whether
developed in one age or another, they must be the
same. He cannot at one time teach that a man
and his house are one, and commend him for ruling
it properly, and at another time teach that they are not
one, but permit him to rule his house as he pleases.
This is impossible. God's approval or disapproval
of things flows out of what He is in Himself; and
in this matter in particular, inasmuch as God rules
His own house according to what He is Himself,
He commands His servants to rule their houses upon
the same principle. Has the dispensation of grace,
or of Christianity, come in to upset this lovely moral
order? God forbid! Nay, it has rather, if possible,
added new traits of beauty thereto. Was the house
of a Jew looked at as part of himself, and shall the
house of a Christian be different? Truly not. It
would be a sad abuse, and an anomalous application
of that heavenly word, "grace," to apply it to the
misrule and demoralization that prevail in the houses
of numberless Christians of the present day. Is it
grace to allow the will to ride rampant? Is it grace
to have all the passions, tempers, whims, and appetites
of a corrupt nature indulged? Alas! call it
not grace, lest our souls should lose the real meaning
of the word, and begin to imagine it to be what
we have called it. Call it by its proper names&mdash;a
monstrous abuse&mdash;a denial of God, not only as the
Ruler of His own house, but as the moral Administrator
of the universe&mdash;a flagrant contradiction of
all the precepts of inspiration on this deeply important
subject.</p>

<p>But let us turn to the New Testament and see if
we cannot find in its sacred pages ample proof of
our thesis. Does the Holy Ghost, in this grand section
of His book, exclude a man's house from the
privileges and responsibilities attached thereto in
the Old Testament? We shall see very plainly that
He does no such thing. Let us have the proofs. In
Christ's commission to His apostles, we find these
words: "And into whatsoever city or town ye shall
enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide
till ye go thence. And when ye come into a house,
salute it. And if the house [not merely the master]
be worthy, let your peace come upon <i>it</i>; but if it be
not worthy, let your peace return to you again."
(Matt. x. 11-13.) Again, "And Jesus said unto
Zacchæus, 'This day is salvation come to <i>this house</i>,
forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. For the
Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which
was lost.'" (Luke xix. 9, 10.) So in the case of
Cornelius&mdash;"Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon,
whose surname is Peter; who shall tell thee words
whereby <i>thou and all thy house</i> shall be saved."
(Acts xi. 13, 14.) So also to the jailer at Philippi&mdash;"Believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and <i>thou shalt
be saved and thy house</i>." (Acts xvi. 31.) Then we
have the practical result&mdash;"And when he had brought
them into his house, he set meat before them, and
rejoiced, believing in God <i>with all his house</i>." (Ver.
34.) In the same chapter, Lydia says, "If ye have
judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into <i>my
house</i> and abide." (Ver. 15.) "The Lord give
mercy unto <i>the house</i> of Onesiphorus." Why? was
it because of its actings toward him? No; but
"because <i>he</i> oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed
of my chain." (2 Tim. i. 16.) "A bishop must
be one that ruleth well his own house, having his
children in subjection with all gravity. For if a man
know not how to rule his own house, how shall he
take care of the Church of God?"</p>

<p>Now, under the term "house," three things are
included, viz., the house itself, the children, and
the servants. All these, whether taken together or
separately, should bear the distinct stamp of God.
The house of a man of God should be ruled for
God, in His name and for His glory. The head of
a Christian household is the representative of God.
Whether as a father or as a master, he is to his
household an expression of the power of God; and
he is bound to walk in the intelligent recognition
and practical development of this fact. It is on this
principle he is to provide for and govern the whole.
Hence, "if any provide not for his own house, he
hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."
By neglecting the sphere over which God has set
him, he proves his ignorance of and unlikeness to
the One whom he is called to represent. This is
plain enough. If I want to know how I am to provide
for and rule my house, I have only carefully to
study the way in which God provides for and rules
His house. This is the true way to learn. Nor is
it here a question as to the actual conversion of the
constituent parts of the household. Not at all.
What I desire to press upon all Christian heads of
houses is, that the whole affair, from one end to the
other, should distinctly wear the stamp of God's
presence and God's authority,&mdash;that there should be
a clear acknowledgment of God on the part of every
member. That every thing should be so conducted
as to elicit the confession, "<i>God is here</i>;" and all
this, not that the head of the house may be praised for
his moral influence and judicious management, but
simply that God may be glorified. This is not too
much to aim at; yea, we should never rest satisfied
with any thing less. A Christian's house should be
but a miniature representation of the house of God,
not so much in the actual condition of individual
members as in the moral order and godly arrangement
of the whole.</p>

<p>Some may shake their heads and say, This is all
very fine, but where will you get it? I only ask,
Does the Word of God teach a Christian man so to
rule his house? If so, woe be to me if I refuse or
fail to do so. That there has been the most grievous
failure in the management of our houses every
honest conscience must admit, but nothing can be
more shameful than for a man calmly and deliberately
to sit down satisfied with a disordered condition
of his house because he cannot attain to the
standard which God has set before him. All I have
to do is to follow the line which Scripture has laid
down, and the blessing must assuredly follow, for
God cannot deny Himself. But if I, in unbelief of
heart, say I cannot reach the blessing, of course I
never shall. Every field of blessing or privilege
which God opens before us demands an energy of
faith to enter. Like Canaan of old to the children
of Israel; there it lay, but they had to go thither,
for the word was, "Every place that thy foot shall
tread upon." Thus it is ever. Faith takes possession
of what God gives. We should aim at every
thing which tends to glorify Him who has made us
all we are or ever shall be.</p>

<p>But what can be more dishonoring to God than
to see the house of His servant the very reverse of
what He would have it? And yet were we to judge
from what constantly meets our view, it would seem
as if many Christians thought that their houses had
nothing whatever to do with their testimony. Most
humbling it is to meet with some who, so far as they
are personally concerned, seem nice Christians, but
who entirely fail in the management of their houses.
They speak of separation from the world, but their
houses present the most distressingly worldly appearance;
they speak of the world being crucified
to them and of their being crucified to the world,
and yet the world is stamped on the very face of
their whole establishment. Every thing seems designed
to minister to the lust of the flesh, the lust
of the eye, and the pride of life. Magnificent pier-glasses
to reflect the flesh; sumptuous carpets, sofas,
and loungers for the ease of the flesh; glittering
chandeliers for the pride and vanity of the flesh.
But it may be said, It is taking low ground to descend
to such particulars. I reply, The daughters
of Zion might just as well have passed the same
comment upon the following solemn appeal: "In
that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their
tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls,
and their round tires like the moon, the chains and
the bracelets and the mufflers, the bonnets and the
ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the
tablets and the earrings, the rings and nose-jewels,
the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles
and the wimples and the crisping-pins, the glasses
and the fine linen and the hoods and the vails."
(Isa. iii. 18-23.)</p>

<p>This was descending to very minute particulars.
The same might be said of the following passage
from Amos: "Woe to them that are at ease in Zion
... that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch
themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs
out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of
the stall; that chant to the sound of the viol, and
invent to themselves instruments of music, like
David." (Chap. vi. 1-5.) The Spirit of God can
descend to particulars when the particulars are there
to be descended to. But it may be further objected,
We must furnish our houses according to our rank
in life. Wherever this objection is urged, it reveals
very fully the real ground of the objector's
soul. That ground is the world, unquestionably.
"<i>Our rank in life</i>"!&mdash;what does this really mean,
as applied to those who profess to be <i>dead</i>? To talk
of our rank in life is to deny the very foundations
of Christianity. If we have rank in life, then it
follows that we must be alive as men in the flesh&mdash;men
according to nature, and then the law has its
full force against us, "for the law hath dominion
over a man as long as he liveth." Hence this rank
in life becomes a serious matter.</p>

<p>But, let me ask, how did we get rank in life? or,
in what life is it? If it be in this life, then we are
liars whenever we talk of being "crucified with
Christ"&mdash;"dead with Christ"&mdash;"buried with Christ"&mdash;"risen
with Christ"&mdash;"outside the camp with
Christ"&mdash;"not in the flesh"&mdash;"not of the world
which fadeth away." All these are so many splendid
lies to those possessing, or pretending to, a rank in this
life. This is the real truth of the matter; and we must
allow the truth to reach and act upon our consciences,
that it may influence our lives. What, then, is the only
life in which we have a rank? The resurrection-life
of Christ. Redeeming love has given us a rank in
this life, and truly we know that worldly furniture,
costly array, ridiculous parade and retinue, have
nothing to do with rank in this life. Ah, no; the
circumstances which comport with rank in heavenly
life are, holiness of character, purity of life, spiritual
power, profound humility, separation from every
thing which directly savors of the flesh and the
world. To furnish our persons and our houses with
these things would be furnishing them "according
to our rank in life." But in point of fact, this
objection does really bring out the true principle at
the heart's core. It has already been remarked that
the house reveals the moral condition of the man,
and this objection confirms that statement. People
who talk, or even think, of rank in life have, "in
their hearts, turned back again into Egypt." And
what does God say will be the end of such? "I
will carry you away beyond Babylon." Yes, it is
greatly to be feared that the great millstone of Revelation
xviii. presents but too true a picture of the
end of much of the sickly, spurious, hollow Christianity
of the present day.</p>

<p>It may, however, be further urged that Christianity
affords no warrant for filthy and irregular houses.
This is most true. I know few things more distressing
and dishonoring than to see the house of a
Christian characterized by filth and confusion. Such
things could never exist in connection with a really
spiritual or even a well-adjusted mind. You may
set it down that there must be something radically
wrong wherever such things exist. Here, in an
especial manner, the house of God presents itself
before us as a blessed model. Over the door of
that house may be seen inscribed this wholesome
motto: "Let all things be done decently and in
order;" and all who love God and His house will
desire to carry out this precept at home.</p>

<p>The next point suggested by the expression,
"Thou and thy house," is the management of our
children. This is a sore and deeply humbling point
to many of us, inasmuch as it discloses a fearful
amount of failure. The condition of the children
tends, more than any thing, to bring out the condition
of the parent. The real measure of my
surrender of the world, and my subjugation of
nature, will constantly be shown in my thoughts
about and treatment of my children. I profess to
have given up the world, so far as I am personally
concerned; but then I have children. Have I given
up the world for them as well? Some may say,
How can I? They are in nature, and must have
the world. Here again the true moral condition of
the heart is revealed. The world is really not given
up, and my children are made an excuse for grasping
again what I professed to have given up, but my
heart retained all the while. Are my children part
of myself, or are they not? Part of myself, assuredly.
Well, then, if I profess to have relinquished
the world for myself and yet am seeking it for them,
what is it but the wretched anomaly of a man half
in Egypt and half in Canaan? We know where
such an one is wholly and in reality. He is wholly
and really in Egypt. Yes, my brethren, here is
where we have to judge ourselves. Our children
tell a tale. The music-master and the dancing-master
are surely not the agents which the Spirit of
God would select to help our children along, nor do
they, by any means, comport with that high-toned
Nazariteship to which we are called. These things
prove that Christ is not the chosen and amply sufficient
portion of our souls. What is sufficient for
me is sufficient for those who are part of me.
And shall I be so base as to train my children
for the devil and the world? Shall I minister to
and pamper that in them which I profess to mortify
in myself? It is a grievous mistake, and we shall
find it so. If my children are in Egypt, I am there
myself. If my children savor of Babylon, I savor
of it myself. If my children belong to a corrupt
worldly religious system, I belong to it myself, in
principle. "Thou and thy house" are one; God
has made them one; and "what He has joined
together, let no man put asunder."</p>

<p>This is a solemn and searching truth, in the light
of which we may clearly see the evil of urging our
children along a path upon which we profess to have
forever turned our backs, as believing firmly that
it terminates in hell fire. We profess to count the
world's literature, its honors, its riches, its distinctions,
its pleasures, all "dung and dross," yet these
very things, which we have declared to be only
hindrances to us in our Christian course, and which,
as such, we have professed to cast aside, we are
diligently setting before our children as things
perfectly essential to their progress. In so doing,
we entirely forget that things which act as clogs to
us cannot possibly act as helps to our children.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
It were infinitely better to throw off the mask, and
declare plainly that we have not given up the world
at all; and nothing ever made this thoroughly manifest
but our children. The Lord, I believe, in
righteous judgment, is taking up the families of
brethren, to show in them the actual condition of
the testimony amongst us. In many cases it is
well known that the children of Christians are the
wildest and most ungodly in the neighborhood.
Should this be so? Would God accept a testimony
at the hand of those who have it so? Would it be
thus if we were walking faithfully before God as to
our houses? These inquiries must be answered in
the negative. If only I get the principle of "Thou
and thy house" firmly fixed in my conscience, and
intelligently wrought into my mind, I shall see it to
be my place to count upon God, and cry to Him,
just as much for the testimony of my house as for
my own testimony. In reality, I cannot separate
them. I may attempt it, but it is vain. How often
has one felt a pang at hearing such words as these:
"Such an one is a very dear, godly, devoted
brother; but, oh! he has the boldest and wildest
children in the neighborhood, and his house is a sad
mess of misrule and confusion." I ask, what is the
testimony of such an one worth in the judgment of
God? Little indeed. Saved he may be; but is
salvation all we want? Is there no testimony to be
given? and if there is, what is it? and where is it to
be seen? Is it confined to the benches of a meeting-room,
or is it to be seen in the midst of a man's
house? The heart can answer.</p>

<p>But it may be urged, Our children will crave a
little worldly enjoyment, and we must indulge them.
We cannot put old heads upon young shoulders. I
reply, Our own hearts often crave a little of the
world likewise. Shall we indulge their craving?
No; but judge it. Exactly so. Do the same in
reference to your children's craving. If I find my
children going out after the world, I should immediately
judge and chasten myself before God, crying
to Him to enable me to put it down, so that the
testimony may not suffer. But I cannot but believe
that if the parent's heart is, from its centre to its
circumference, purged of the world, its principles,
and its lusts, it will exert a mighty influence upon
his whole house. This is what makes this entire
question one of such vast magnitude and practical
weight. Is my house a just criterion by which to
judge of my real condition? I believe the whole
teaching of Scripture is in favor of an affirmative.
This makes the matter peculiarly solemn. How am
I walking before my family? Is my whole course
and character so unequivocal that all can see that
my one supreme object is Christ, and that I would
just as soon, if I could, unlock the portals of hell,
and let my children in, as educate them for the
world, or seek the world for them?</p>

<p>This I feel to be a startling inquiry; yet it is one
which we are bound to follow up to the uttermost.
What has called into existence, in many cases, that
awful profanity, that disposition to scoff at sacred
things, that utter distaste for the Scriptures, and
for meetings where the Scriptures are brought
forward, that skeptical and infidel spirit so sadly
apparent in the children of Christian professors?
Will any one undertake to say that the parents have
nothing to do with this, in the judgment of God?
May not much of this be justly traced to the sad
incongruity between the professed principles and
the actual practices of the parents? I believe it may.
Children are shrewd observers. They very soon
begin to discover what their parents are really at.
They will gather this, too, much more speedily and
accurately from their <i>doings</i> than from their <i>prayings</i>
or their <i>sayings</i>; and although the parents may
teach that the world and its ways are bad, and
though they may pray that their children may know
the Lord, yet inasmuch as they are educating them
for the world, and seeking most industriously to
push them on in it, grasping at and getting in by
every opening, and congratulating themselves when
they have succeeded in settling them there, it necessarily
follows that the children begin to say in their
hearts, "The world is a good place after all, for
my parents thank God on getting me a berth in it,
and look upon it as a most marked opening of Providence.
All that peculiar talk of theirs, therefore,
about being dead to the world, and being risen with
Christ&mdash;the world's being under judgment, and
their being strangers and pilgrims therein&mdash;all this
must be rank nonsense, or else Christians, so called,
must be rank deceivers." Will any one say that
such reasoning as this has not passed through the
mind of many a professor's child? I cannot doubt
it. The grace of God, no doubt, is sovereign, and
often triumphs over all our errors and failures; but
oh! let us think of the testimony, and let us see that
our houses are really ordered for God and not for
Satan.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>But it will be said, How are our children to get
on? must they not earn their bread? Unquestionably.
God formed us for work. The very fact of
my having a pair of hands proves that I am not to
be idle. But I need not push my son back into
that world which I have left, in order to give him
employment. The Most High God, the Possessor
of heaven and earth, had one Son, His only begotten,
the Heir of all things, by whom also He made the
worlds; He did not take up any of the learned professions,
but was known as "the carpenter." Has
this no voice for us? Christ has gone up on high
and taken His seat at God's right hand. As thus
risen, He is our Head, Representative, and Model;
but He has left us an example that we should follow
His steps. Are we following His steps in seeking
to push our children on in that very world which
crucified Him? Surely not: we are adopting the
very opposite course, and the end will be accordingly.
"Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap." As
we sow, in reference to our children, so shall we
also reap. If we sow to the flesh and the world, we
cannot expect to reap otherwise. But I would not,
by any means, be understood to teach that a
Christian parent ought to place his child below the
level on which the Lord has placed himself. I do
not believe he would be warranted in so doing. If
my calling be a godly one, it may suit my child as
well as it suits myself. All cannot be carpenters,
it is true; yet one feels that, in an age of progress
like the present, where "onward and upward in the
world" seems to be the great motto, there is a deep
moral for the heart in the fact that the Son of God&mdash;the
Creator and Sustainer of the universe&mdash;was only
known amongst men as "the carpenter." It assuredly
teaches that Christians should not be found
seeking "great things" for their children.</p>

<p>However, it is not merely in reference to the object
set forth in our children's education that we
have failed, and so marred the testimony; but also
in the matter of keeping them in general subjection
to parental authority. On this point there has been
great deficiency amongst Christian parents. The
spirit of the present age is that of insubordination.
"Disobedient to parents" forms a trait in the
apostasy of the last days; and we have specially
helped on its development by an entirely false application
of the principle of grace, as also by not
seeing that there is involved in the parental relationship
a principle of power exercised in righteousness,
without which our houses must prove to be scenes
of lawlessness and wild confusion. It is no grace
to pamper an unsanctified will. We mourn over
our own lack of a broken will, and yet we are
strengthening the will in our children. It is always,
to my mind, a manifest proof of the weakness of
parental authority, as well as of ignorance of the
way in which the servant of God should rule his
house, to hear a parent say to a child, "<i>Will</i> you
do so and so?" This question, simple as it seems,
tends directly to create or minister to the very
thing which you ought to put down, by every means
in your power, and that is, the exercise of the
child's <i>will</i>. Instead, therefore, of asking the child,
"Will you do?" just tell him what he is to do,
and let there not be in his mind the idea of calling
in question your authority. The parent's will should
be supreme with a child, because the parent stands
in the place of God. All power belongs to God,
and He has invested His servant with power, both
as a father and a master. If, therefore, the child
or the servant resist this power, it is resistance of
God.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count
their own masters worthy of all honor, that the
name of <i>God</i> and His doctrine be not blasphemed."
Observe, it is "God and His doctrine." Why?
Because it is a question of power. The name of
Christ and His doctrine would put the master and
servant on a level, as members of one body. In
Christ Jesus there is no distinction; but when I go
abroad in the world, I encounter God's moral
government, which makes one a master and another
a servant; and any infringement upon that government
will meet with certain judgment.</p>

<p>Now, it is of immense importance to have a clear
understanding of the doctrine of God's moral government.
It would settle many a difficulty, and solve
many a question. This government is carried on
with a righteous decision, which is peculiarly solemnizing.
If we look through Scripture in reference
to this subject, we shall find that in every instance
in which there has been error or failure, it has
inevitably produced its own results. Adam took of
the forbidden fruit, and he was instantly thrust forth
from the garden, into a world groaning beneath the
curse and weight of his sin. Nor was he ever replaced
in paradise. True, grace came in, and gave
him a promise of a Deliverer; moreover, it clothed
his naked shoulders. Nevertheless, his sin produced
its own result. He made a false step, and he never
recovered it. Again, Moses, at the waters of
Meribah, uttered a hasty word, and immediately a
righteous God forbad his entrance into Canaan. In
his case likewise grace came in, and gave him
something better; for it was much better, from the
top of Pisgah, to inspect the plains of Palestine in
company with Jehovah than to inhabit them in company
with Israel. So also in David's case. He
committed a sin, and the solemn denunciation was
immediately issued, "The sword shall never depart
from thy house." In his case too grace abounded,
and he enjoyed a more profound sense of grace as
he ascended the side of Mount Olivet with bare feet
and covered head than he ever had enjoyed amid the
splendors of a throne; nevertheless, his sin produced
its own result. He made a false step, and he never
recovered it.</p>

<p>Nor is the exemplification of this principle confined
merely to Old-Testament times. By no means.
Look at the case of Barnabas. He gave utterance
to the seemingly amiable desire to have the company
of his nephew Mark, and, from that moment, he
loses his honorable place in the records of the Holy
Ghost. He is never heard of afterward, and his
place was supplied with a more wholly devoted
heart.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Hence God's moral government is a most
momentous truth. It is such, that as surely as one
does wrong, he will reap the fruit of it, no matter
who he is&mdash;believer or unbeliever, saint or sinner.
Grace may forgive the sin, and will, where it is confessed
and judged; but inasmuch as the principles
of God's moral government have been interfered
with, the offender must be made to feel his mistake.
He has missed a step of the wheel, and he shall
assuredly feel the consequences. This is a most
solemn but specially wholesome truth, the action of
which has been sadly clogged by false notions about
grace. God never allows His grace to interfere
with His moral government. He could not do so,
because it would produce confusion, and "God is
not the author of confusion."</p>

<p>It is here there has been so much failure in the
management of our houses. We have forgotten the
principle of righteous rule which God has set before
us, and in the exercise of which He has given us an
example. My reader must not confound the principle
of God's government with the aspect of His character.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
These two things are distinct. The former
is righteousness, the latter is grace; but what I here
desire to bring out is, the fact that there is a principle
of righteousness involved in the relationship of father
and master, and if this principle receive not its due
place in the management of the family, there must
be confusion. If I see a <i>strange</i> child doing wrong,
I have no divine authority to exercise righteous discipline
toward him; but the moment I see my own
child doing so, I put him under discipline. Why?
because I am his father. But it may be said, The
parental relationship is one of love. True; it is
founded in love: "Behold, what manner of love the
Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be
called the sons of God." But although the relationship
is founded in love, it is exercised in righteousness,
for "the time is come when judgment
must begin at the house of God." So also, in Hebrews
xii, we are taught that the very fact of our being
genuine sons brings us under the righteous discipline
of the Father's hand. In John xvii, too,
the Church is committed to the care of the Holy
Father, to be kept by Him through His own name.

<p>Now, in every case in which this great truth has
been lost sight of by Christian parents, their houses
have been thrown into confusion. They have not
governed their children, and as a consequence, their
children have, in process of time, governed them,
for there will be government somewhere; and if
those into whose hands God has put the reins do not
hold them properly, they will speedily fall into bad
hands; and can there be a more melancholy sight
than to see parents governed by their children?
I believe, in God's sight, it presents a fearful moral
blot, which must bring down His judgment. A
parent who lets the reins of government drop from
his hands, or who does not hold them steadily, has
grievously failed in his high and holy position as
the representative of God, and the depositary of
His power; nor do I believe that any one so failing
can ever thoroughly regain his place, or be a proper
witness for God in his day and generation. A
subject of grace he may be; but then, a subject of
grace and a witness for God are two widely different
things. This will account for the sorrowful condition
of many brethren. They have utterly failed to
govern their houses, and hence they have lost their
true position and moral influence&mdash;their energies
are paralyzed, their mouths closed, their testimony
hushed; and if such do lift the voice in some feeble
way, the finger of scorn is instantly pointed at their
families, and this cannot but send a blush to the
cheek and a pang to the conscience.</p>

<p>Nor do people always take a correct view of this
matter, and trace the failure up to its legitimate
source. Many are too ready to look upon it as a
natural and necessary thing that their children are
to grow up willful and worldly. They say, It is all
very well while your children are young, but wait
till they grow older, and you will see that you must
let them go into the world. Now, I want to know,
is it the mind of God that the children of His servants
must necessarily grow up willful and worldly?
I never could believe any such thing. Well, then,
if it be not His mind that they should so grow up,&mdash;if
He has graciously opened the same path to my
house as He has opened to myself,&mdash;if He has permitted
me to select the same portion for my children
as I have, through His grace, selected for myself,&mdash;if,
after all this, my children grow up willful and
worldly, what am I to infer? Why, that I have
grievously sinned and failed in my parental relationship
and responsibilities&mdash;that I have wronged
my children and dishonored the Lord. Shall I go
and make a general principle of this, and set it down
that all the children of Christians must grow up as
mine have? Shall I go and discourage young parents
from taking God's ground in reference to their dear
children, by setting before them my abominable
failure, instead of encouraging them by setting
before them God's infallible faithfulness to all who
seek Him in the way of His appointment? To act
thus would be to follow in the steps of the old
prophet of Bethel, who, because he was in the midst
of evil himself, sought to drag his brother in also,
and had him slain by a lion for disobeying the word
of the Lord.</p>

<p>But the sum of the matter is this: The willfulness
of my children reveals the willfulness of my own
heart, and a righteous God is using them to chasten
me, because I have not chastened myself. This is
a peculiarly solemn view of the case, and one that
calls for deep searching of heart. To save myself
trouble, I have let things take their course in my
family, and now my children have grown up around
me to be thorns in my side, because I trained them
not for God. This is the history of thousands. We
should ever bear in mind that our children, as well
as ourselves, should be "set for the defense and
confirmation of the gospel." I feel persuaded that,
could we only be led to regard our houses as a
testimony for God, it would produce an immense
reformation in our mode of ruling them. We should
then seek a high tone of moral order, not that we
might be spared any trouble or vexation, but rather
that the testimony might not suffer through any
confusion in our families. But let us not forget,
that in order to subdue nature in our children, we
must subdue it in ourselves. We can never subdue
nature by nature. It is only as we have crushed it
in ourselves that we are in a position to crush it
in our children. Moreover, there must be the
clearest understanding and the fullest harmony between
the father and mother. Their voice, their
will, their authority, their influence, should be essentially
one&mdash;one in the strictest sense of that word.
Being themselves "no more twain, but one flesh,"
they should ever appear before their children in the
beauty and power of that oneness. In order to this,
they must wait much upon God together&mdash;they must
be much in His presence, opening up all their hearts,
and telling out all their need. Christians do frequently
injure one another in this respect. It sometimes
happens that one partner really desires to give
up the world and subdue nature to an extent for
which the other is not prepared, and this produces
sad results. It sometimes leads to reserve, to
shuffling, to management and generalship, to positive
antagonism in the views and principles of husband
and wife, so that they cannot really be said to be
joined in the Lord. The effect of all this upon the
children as they grow up is pernicious beyond all
conception; and the influence which it exerts in
deranging the entire house is quite incalculable.
What the father commands, the mother remits;
what the father builds up, the mother pulls down.
Sometimes the father is represented as stern, severe,
arbitrary, and exacting. The maternal influence
acts outside and independent of the paternal;
sometimes, even, it sets it aside altogether; so that
the father's position becomes wretched in the extreme,
and the whole family presents a most
demoralized and ungodly appearance.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This is terrible.
Children never could be properly trained under
such circumstances; and as to testimony for Christ,
the bare thought of it is monstrous. Wherever
such a state of things prevails, there should be the
deepest sorrow of heart before the Lord on account
of it. His mercy is exhaustless, and His tender
compassions fail not; and surely we may hope that,
where there is true contrition and confession, God
will graciously come in with healing and restoration.
One thing is certain, that we should not go on
content to have things so; therefore, let the one who
feels the sorrow of heart cry mightily to God, day
and night&mdash;cry to Him on the ground of His own
truth and name, which are blasphemed by such
things; and, be assured, He will hear and answer.</p>

<p><i>But let all be viewed in the light of testimony for
God's Son.</i> It is to further this we are left here.
We are surely not left here merely to bring up
families. We are left here to bring them up for
God, with God, by God, and before God. To do
all this, we must be much in His presence. A
Christian parent should take great care not to
punish his children merely to gratify his whims and
tempers. He is to represent God in the midst of
his family. This, when properly understood, will
regulate every thing. He is God's steward, likewise,
and in order rightly and intelligently to discharge
the functions of his stewardship, he must
have frequent&mdash;yea, unbroken&mdash;intercourse with his
Master. He must be constantly betaking himself
to His feet, to know what he is to do, and how he is
to do it. This will make every thing easy and
happy. It is often the desire of one's heart to get
an abstract rule for this, that, and the other thing,
in the details of family arrangement. One may ask
what sort of punishments, what sort of rewards,
what sort of amusements, should a Christian parent
adopt. Actual punishment will, I believe, rarely be
called for, if the divine principle of government be
carried out from the earliest date; and as to rewards,
it would be better to put them in the light of
expressions of love and approval. A child must be
obedient&mdash;unqualifiedly and unhesitatingly obedient&mdash;not
to get a reward, which is apt to feed emulation,
a fruit of the flesh; but because God would
have him so; and then, of course, it is quite allowable
for the parent to express his approval in the
shape of some little present. As to amusement, let
it always, if possible, assume the character of some
useful occupation. This is most salutary. It is a
bad thing to cherish the thought in the mind of a
child that painted toys and gilded baubles minister
pleasure. With very young children, I have constantly
found that they derived more real, and
certainly much more simple pleasure from a piece of
stick or paper made out by themselves, than from
the most expensive toy. Finally, let us, in all things,
whether punishment, reward, or amusement, keep
the eye on Christ, and earnestly seek the subjugation
of the flesh in every shape and form. So shall
our houses be a testimony for God, and all who
enter them be constrained to say, "<span class="smcap">God is here</span>."</p>

<p>As to the management of servants in a Christian
household, the principle is equally simple. The
master, as the head of the house, is the expression
of the power of God, and as such, he must insist
upon subjection and obedience. It is not a question
of the Christianity of the servants, but simply of the
order which should ever be maintained in a Christian
household. Here, too, we must be on our guard
against the mere indulgence of our own arbitrary
temper. We have to remember that we have a
Master in heaven, who has taught us to "give unto
our servants that which is just and equal." If only
we set the Lord before us from day to day, and
seek to exhibit Him in all our dealings with our
servants, we shall be kept from error on every side.</p>

<p>I must now close. I have not written, the Lord
knows, to wound anyone. I feel the truth, importance,
and deep solemnity of the points here put
forward, and also my own lack of ability to bring
them out with sufficient distinctness and power.
However, I look to God to make them influential;
and where He works, the very weakest agency will
answer His end. To Him I now commend these
pages, which have, I trust, been begun, continued,
and ended in His holy presence. The thought has
comforted me not a little, that at the very moment
in which it was laid on my conscience to prepare
this paper, a number of beloved brethren were
actually assembled for humiliation, confession, and
prayer, in immediate connection with the testimony
of God's Son in these last days. I doubt not that
a very leading point of confession has been failure
in the government of the house; and if these pages
should be used of God's Spirit to produce, even in
one conscience, a deeper sense of this failure, and in
one heart, a more earnest desire to meet the failure
in God's own way, I shall rejoice, and feel I have
not written in vain.</p>

<p>May God Almighty, in His great grace, produce,
by His Holy Spirit, in the hearts of all His beloved
saints, a more ardent purpose of soul to raise, in
this closing hour, a fuller, brighter, more vigorous
and decided testimony for Christ, that so, ere the
shout of the archangel and the trump of God are
heard in the air, there may be a people prepared to
meet and welcome the heavenly Bridegroom.</p>

<h2>DISCIPLESHIP IN AN EVIL DAY</h2>


<p>The first three chapters of the Book of Daniel
furnish a most seasonable and important lesson
at a time like the present, in which the disciple is
in such danger of yielding to surrounding influences,
and of lowering his standard of testimony and his
tone of discipleship, in order to meet the existing
condition of things.</p>

<p>At the opening of chapter i. we have a most discouraging
picture of the state of things, in reference
to the ostensible witness of God on the earth. "In
the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, king of
Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, unto
Jerusalem, and besieged it. And the Lord gave
Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into his hand, with part
of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried
into the land of Shinar, to the house of his god;
and he brought the vessels into the house of his
god." (Chap. i. 1, 2.) Here then we have an aspect
of things quite sufficient, if looked at from
nature's point of view, to discourage the heart, to
damp the spirit, and paralyse the energies. Jerusalem
in ruins, the temple trodden down, the Lord's
vessels in the house of a false god, and Judah carried
away captive. Surely the heart would feel disposed
to say, There is no use in seeking to hold up
the standard of practical discipleship and personal
devotedness any longer. The spirit must droop,
the heart must faint, and the hands must hang down,
when such is the condition of the people of God.
It could be nought but the greatest presumption
for any of Judah's sons to think of taking up true
Nazarite's position at such a time.</p>

<p>Such would be nature's reasoning; but such was
not the language of faith. Blessed be God! there
is always a wide sphere in which the spirit of genuine
devotedness can develop itself&mdash;there is always a
path along which the true disciple can run, even
though he should have to run in solitude. It matters
not what the outward condition of things may
be, it is faith's privilege to hang as much on God,
to feed as much on Christ, and to breathe as much
of the air of heaven, as though all were in perfect
order and harmony.</p>

<p>This is an unspeakable mercy to the faithful heart.
All who desire to walk devotedly can always find a
path to walk in; whereas, on the contrary, the man
who draws a plea, from outward circumstances, for
relaxing his energy, would not be energetic, though
most favorably situated.</p>

<p>If ever there was a time in which one might be
excused for taking a low ground, it was the time of
the Babylonish captivity. The entire framework of
Judaism was broken up; the kingly power had
passed out of the hand of David's successor, and
into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar; the glory had
departed from Israel; and, in one word, all seemed
faded and gone, and nought remained for the exiled
children of Judah, save to hang their harps upon
the willows, and sit down by the rivers of Babylon,
there to weep over departed glory, faded light, and
fallen greatness.</p>

<p>Such would be the language of blind unbelief;
but, blessed be God! it is when everything appears
sunk to the lowest possible point, that then faith
rises in holy triumph; and faith, we know, is the
only true basis of effective discipleship. It asks for
no props from the men and things around it; it finds
"<i>all</i> its springs" in God; and hence it is that faith
never shines so brightly as when all around is dark.
It is when nature's horizon is overcast with the
blackest clouds, that faith basks in the sunshine of
the divine favor and faithfulness.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Daniel and his companions were
enabled to overcome the peculiar difficulties of their
time. They judged that there was nothing to hinder
their enjoying as elevated a Nazariteship in
Babylon as ever had been known in Jerusalem; and
they judged rightly. Their judgment was the judgment
of a pure and well-founded faith. It was the
selfsame judgment on which the Baraks, the Gideons,
the Jephthahs, and the Samsons of old had
acted. It was the judgment to which Jonathan gave
utterance, when he said, "There is no restraint with
the Lord to save by many or by few." (1 Sam. xiv.)
It was the judgment of David, in the valley of Elah,
when he called the poor trembling host of Israel
"the army of the living God." (1 Sam. xvii.) It
was the judgment of Elijah, on Mount Carmel, when
he built an altar with "twelve stones according
to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob."
(1 Kings xviii.) It was the judgment of Daniel
himself when, at a further stage of his history, he
opened his window and prayed toward Jerusalem.
(Dan. vi.) It was the judgment of Paul when, in
view of the overwhelming tide of apostasy and corruption
which was about to set in, he exhorts his
son Timothy to "hold fast the form of sound words."
(2 Tim. i. 13.) It was the judgment of Peter when,
in prospect of the dissolution of the entire framework
of creation, he encourages believers to "be diligent,
that they be found of him in peace, without spot
and blameless." (2 Peter iii. 14.) It was the judgment
of John when, amid the actual breaking up of
everything ecclesiastical, he exhorts his well-beloved
Gaius to "follow not that which is evil, but that
which is good." (3 John 11.) And it was the judgment
of Jude when, in the presence of the most appalling
wickedness, he encourages a beloved remnant
to "build themselves up in their most holy faith, praying
in the Holy Ghost, to keep themselves in the
love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ unto eternal life." (Jude 20, 21.) In one
word, it was the judgment of the Holy Ghost, and,
therefore, it was the judgment of faith.</p>

<p>Now, all this attaches immense value and interest
to Daniel's determination, as expressed in the first
chapter of this book. "But Daniel purposed in his
heart that he would not defile himself with the portion
of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he
drank; therefore he requested of the prince of the
eunuchs that he might not defile himself." (Ver. 8.)
He might, very naturally, have said to himself,
"There is no use in one poor feeble captive seeking
to maintain a place of separation. Everything is
broken up. It is impossible to carry out the true
spirit of a Nazarite amid such hopeless ruin and
degradation. I may as well accommodate myself
to the condition of things around me."</p>

<p>But no; Daniel was on higher ground than this.
He knew it was his privilege to live as close to God
in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, as within the gates
of Jerusalem. He knew that, let the outward condition
of the people of God be what it might, there
was a path of purity and devotedness opened to the
individual saint, which he could pursue independently
of everything.</p>

<p>And may we not say, that the Nazariteship of
Babylon possesses charms and attractions fully as
powerful as the Nazariteship of Canaan? Unquestionably.
It is unspeakably precious and beautiful,
to find one of the captives in Babylon breathing
after, and attaining unto, so elevated a standard of
separation. It teaches a powerful lesson for every
age. It holds up to the view of believers, under
every dispensation, a most encouraging and soul-stirring
example. It proves that, amid the darkest
shades, a devoted heart can enjoy a path of cloudless
sunshine.</p>

<p>But how is this? Because "Jesus Christ is the
same yesterday, to-day, and forever." (Heb. xiii.)
Dispensations change and pass away. Ecclesiastical
institutions crumble and moulder into ashes. Human
systems totter and fall; but the name of Jehovah
endureth forever, and His memorial unto all
generations. It is upon this holy elevation that
faith plants its foot. It rises above all vicissitude,
and enjoys sweet converse with the unchangeable
and eternal Source of all real good.</p>

<p>Thus it was that, in the days of the judges, individual
faith was manifested and achieved more
glorious triumphs than ever were known in the days
of Joshua. Thus it was that Elijah's altar on Mount
Carmel was surrounded by a halo fully as bright as
that which crowned the altar of Solomon.</p>

<p>This is truly encouraging. The poor heart is so
apt to sink, and be discouraged, by looking at the
failure and unfaithfulness of man, instead of at the
infallible faithfulness of God. "The foundation of
God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord
knoweth them that are His. And, Let every one
that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."
(2 Tim. ii. 19.) What can ever touch this
enduring truth? Nothing! And, therefore, nothing
can touch the faith which lays hold of it, or the
superstructure of practical devotedness which is
erected on the foundation of that faith.</p>

<p>And then look at the glorious results of Daniel's
devotedness and separation. In the three opening
chapters we observe three distinct things, resulting
from the position assumed by Daniel and his companions,
in reference to "the king's meat." 1, They
were let into the secret of "<i>the king's dream</i>."
2, They withstood the seductions of "<i>the king's
image</i>." And, 3, They were brought unscathed
through "<i>the king's furnace</i>."</p>

<p>I. "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
Him." This is beautifully exemplified in the case
before us. "The magicians, and the astrologers,
and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans," who were
breathing the atmosphere of the royal presence,
were all in the dark as to the royal dream. "The
Chaldeans answered before the king, and said,
There is not a man upon the earth that can shew
the king's matter." Very likely; but there was a
God in heaven who knew all about it; and who,
moreover, could unfold it to those who had faith
enough, and devotedness enough, and self-denial
enough, to separate themselves from Babylonish
pollutions, though involved in the Babylonish captivity.
The mazes, the labyrinths, and the enigmas
of human things are all plain to God; and He can
and does make them plain to those who walk with
Him, in the sanctity of His holy presence. God's
Nazarites can see farther into human affairs than
the most profound philosophers of this world. And
how is this? How can they so readily unravel the
world's mysteries? Because they are above the
world's mists. They are apart from the world's
defilements. They are in the place of separation,
the place of dependence, the place of communion.
"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing
known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his
companions: that they would desire mercies of the
God of heaven, concerning this secret." (Chap. ii.
17, 18.) Here we have their place of strength and
intelligence. They had only to look up to heaven,
in order to be endowed with a clear understanding
as to all the destinies of earth.</p>

<p>How real and simple is all this? "God is light,
and in Him is no darkness at all;" and, hence, if
we want light, we can find it only in His presence;
and we can only know the power of His presence as
we are practically taking the place of separation
from all the moral pollutions of earth.</p>

<p>And, observe, a further result of Daniel's holy
separation. "Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell
upon his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded
that they should offer an oblation and
sweet odors unto him." Here we have earth's
proudest and most powerful monarch at the feet of
the captive exile. Magnificent fruit of faithfulness!
Precious evidence of the truth that God will always
honor the faith that can, in any measure, rise to the
height of His thoughts! He will not, He cannot,
dishonor the draft which confidence presents at His
exhaustless treasury. Daniel, on this memorable
occasion, realized, in his own person, as fully as
ever it was realized, God's ancient promise: "And
all people of the earth shall see that thou art called
by the name of the Lord; and they shall be afraid
of thee.... And the Lord shall make thee the
head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above
only, and thou shalt not be beneath." (Deut. xxviii.
10, 13.)</p>

<p>Assuredly Daniel was, in the above scene, "the
head," and Nebuchadnezzar "the tail," as looked
at from the divine point of view. Witness, also,
the bearing of this holy Nazarite, in the presence of
the impious Belshazzar. (Dan. v. 17-29.) Have we
not, here, as magnificent a testimony to the destined
pre-eminence of the seed of Abraham, as when
Joshua's victorious captains placed their feet on the
necks of the kings of Canaan (Joshua x. 24); or,
when "all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his
wisdom, which God had put in his heart?" (1 Kings
x. 24.) Unquestionably; and, in a certain sense, it
is a more magnificent testimony. It is natural to
expect such a scene in the history of Joshua, or of
Solomon; but to find the haughty king of Babylon
prostrate at the feet of one of his captives, is something
far beyond the utmost stretch of nature's expectation.</p>

<p>There it is, however, as a most striking and
soul-stirring proof of the power of faith to triumph
over all manner of difficulties, and to produce the
most extraordinary results. Faith is the same
mighty principle, whether it act on the plains of
Palestine, on the top of Carmel, by the rivers of
Babylon, or amid the ruins of the professing Church.
No fetters can bind it, no difficulties deter it, no
pressure damp it, no changes affect it. It ever
rises to its proper object, and that object is God
Himself, and His eternal revelation. Dispensations
may change, ages may run their course, the wheels
of time may roll on, and crush beneath their ponderous
weight the fondest hopes of the poor human
heart; but there stands faith, that immortal, divine,
eternal reality, drinking at the fountain of pure
truth, and finding all its springs in Him, who is
"the way, the truth, and the life."</p>

<p>By this "precious faith" it was that Daniel acted,
when he "purposed that he would not defile himself
with the king's meat." True, he could no longer
ascend to that holy and beautiful house, where his
fathers had worshipped. The rude foot of a foreign
foe had trodden down the holy city. The fire no
longer burned on the altar of the God of Israel.
The golden candlestick no longer enlightened, with
its seven lamps, the holy place. But there was faith
in Daniel's heart, and that faith carried him beyond
every surrounding influence, and enabled him to
appropriate, and act in the power of, "all the promises
of God," which are "Yea, and Amen in Christ
Jesus." Faith is not affected by ruined temples,
fallen cities, faded lights, or departed glories. Why
not? Because God is not affected by them. God
is always to be found; and faith is always sure to
find Him.</p>

<p>II. But the same faith which enabled those holy
men of old to refuse the king's meat, enabled them,
also, to despise the king's image. They had separated
themselves from defilement, in order that they
might enjoy a more intense communion with the
true God; and they could not, therefore, bow down
to an image of gold, even though it were ever so
high. They knew that God was not an image.
They knew He was a reality. They could only
present worship to Him, for He alone was the true
object thereof.</p>

<p>Nor did it make any matter to them that all the
world was against them. They had only to live and
act for God. It might seem as if they were setting
up to be wiser than their neighbors. It might savor
of presumption to stand against the tide of public
opinion. Some might feel disposed to ask if truth
lay only with them? Were all "the princes, the
governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers,
the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the
provinces," sunk in darkness and error? Could it
be possible that so many men of rank, of intelligence,
and of learning were in the wrong, and only
a few strangers of the captivity in the right?</p>

<p>With such questions our Nazarites had nothing
to do. Their path lay right onward. Should they
bow down and worship an image, in order to avoid
the appearance of condemning other people? Assuredly
not. And yet how often are those who
desire to keep a conscience void of offence in the
sight of God, condemned for setting themselves up
and judging others! Doubtless Luther was condemned
by many for setting himself up in opposition
to the doctors, the cardinals, and the pope.
Should he, in order to avoid such condemnation,
have lived and died in error? Who would say so?</p>

<p>"Ah! but," some will reply, "Luther had to deal
with palpable error." So thought Luther; but
thousands of learned and eminent men thought
otherwise. So also in the case of "Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego," they had to do with positive
idolatry; but the whole world differed from them.
What then? "We must obey God rather than man."
Let others do as they will; "as for me and my
house, we will serve the Lord." If people were to
remain in error and continue to do what they, at
least, feel to be wrong, in order to avoid the appearance
of judging others, where should we be?</p>

<p>Ah! no; my beloved reader, do you seek to pursue
the steady, onward, upward path of pure and
elevated discipleship. And, whether or not you
thereby condemn others, is no concern of yours.
"<span class="smcap">Cease to do evil.</span>" This is the first thing for
the true disciple to do. When he has yielded obedience
to this golden precept, he may expect to
"learn to do well." "If thine eye be single, thy
whole body shall be full of light." When God
speaks, I am not to turn round to see how my obedience
to His voice will affect my neighbors, or to
consider what they will think about me. When the
voice of the risen and glorified Jesus fell upon the
ear of the prostrate Saul of Tarsus, he did not begin
to enquire what the chief priests and Pharisees
would think of him were he to obey. Surely not.
"Immediately," he says, "I conferred not with flesh
and blood." (Gal. i. 16.) "Whereupon, O king
Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision." (Acts xxvi. 19.) This is the true spirit and
principle of discipleship. "Give glory to God, before
He cause darkness, and your feet stumble upon
the dark mountains." Nothing can be more dangerous
than to hesitate, when divine light shines
upon the path. If you do not act upon the light,
when you get it, you will, assuredly, be involved in
thick darkness. Hence, therefore, as another has
said, "Never go before your faith, nor lag behind
your conscience."</p>

<p>III. But, we have said, if our Nazarites refused
to bow before the king's image, they had to encounter
the king's rage, and the king's furnace. For
all this they were, by the grace of God, prepared:
their Nazariteship was a real thing; they were ready
to suffer the loss of all things, and even life itself, in
defence of the true worship of the God of Israel.
"They worshipped and served their own God," not
merely beneath the peaceful vine and fig-tree in the
land of Canaan, but in the very face of "a burning
fiery furnace." They acknowledged Jehovah, not
merely in the midst of a congregation of true worshippers,
but in the presence of an opposing world.
Theirs was a true discipleship in an evil day. They
loved the Lord; and, therefore, for His sake, they
abstained from the king's luxuries, they withstood
the king's rage, and they endured the king's furnace.
"O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer
thee in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we
serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
furnace; and He will deliver us out of thine hand,
O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king,
that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the
golden image which thou hast set up." This was
the language of men who knew whose they were,
and where they were&mdash;of men who had calmly and
deliberately counted the cost&mdash;of men to whom the
Lord was everything, the world nothing. All that
the world could offer, together with life itself, was
at stake; but what of that? "They endured as
seeing Him who is invisible." Eternal glory lay
before them; and they were quite prepared to reach
that glory by a fiery pathway. God can take His
servants to heaven by a chariot of fire, or by a furnace
of fire, as seems good to Him. Whatever be
the mode of going, it is well to get there.</p>

<p>But could not the Lord have preserved His beloved
servants from being cast into the furnace?
No doubt. This would have been but a very small
matter to Him. He did not, however, do so: it
was His will that the faith of His servants should be
put to the test&mdash;should be tried in the furnace&mdash;should
be passed through the most searching crucible,
in order that it "might be found to praise and
honor and glory." Is it because the refiner sets no
value on the wedge of gold, that he puts it into the
furnace? No; but because he does. And, as some
one has beautifully remarked, "His object is not
merely to remove the dross, but to brighten the
metal."</p>

<p>It is very evident that had the Lord, by an act of
<i>power</i>, kept His servants out of the furnace, there
would have been less glory to Him and as a consequence,
less blessing to them. It was far better to
have His presence and sympathy in the furnace,
than His power to keep them out of it. What glory
to Him in this! And what unspeakable privilege
to them! The Lord went down and walked <i>with</i>
His Nazarites in the furnace into which their faithfulness
had brought them. They had walked with
God in the king's palace; and God walked with
them in the king's furnace. This was the most
elevated moment in the entire career of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego. How little had the king
imagined the lofty position in which he was placing
the objects of his rage and fury! Every eye was
turned from the great image of gold, to gaze, in
astonishment, upon the three captives. What could
it mean? "Three men <i>bound</i>!" "Four men
<i>loose</i>!" Could it be real? Was the furnace real?
Alas, "the most mighty men in the king's army"
had proved it to be real. And, had Nebuchadnezzar's
image been cast into it, it would have proved
its reality also. There was no material for the
sceptic or the infidel to work upon. It was a real
furnace, and a real flame, and the "three men"
were "bound in their coats, their hosen, and their
hats, and their other garments." All was reality.</p>

<p>But there was a deeper reality: <i>God was there</i>.
This changed everything: it "changed the king's
word," changed the furnace into a place of high and
holy fellowship&mdash;changed Nebuchadnezzar's bondmen
into God's freemen.</p>

<p><i>God was there!</i>&mdash;there, in his power, to write
contempt upon all man's opposition&mdash;there, in His
deep and tender sympathy with His tried and faithful
servants&mdash;there, in His matchless grace, to set
the captives free, and to lead the hearts of His
Nazarites into that deep fellowship with Himself
for which they so ardently thirsted.</p>

<p>And, my beloved reader, is it not worth passing
through a fiery furnace to enjoy a little more of the
presence of Christ, and the sympathy of His loving
heart? Are not fetters, with Christ, better than
jewels without Him? Is not a furnace where He is
better than a palace where He is not? Nature says,
"<i>No!</i>" Faith says, "<i>Yes!</i>"</p>

<p>It is well to bear in mind that this is not the day
of Christ's <i>power</i>; but it is the day of His <i>sympathy</i>.
When passing through the deep waters of affliction,
the heart may, at times, feel disposed to ask, "Why
does not the Lord display His power, and deliver
me?" The answer is, This is not the day of His
power. He could avert that sickness&mdash;He could
remove that difficulty&mdash;He could take off that pressure&mdash;He
could prevent that catastrophe&mdash;He could
preserve that beloved and fondly-cherished object
from the cold grasp of death. But, instead of putting
forth His power to deliver, He allows things to
run their course, and pours His own sweet sympathy
into the oppressed and riven heart, in such a way
as to elicit the acknowledgment that we would not,
for worlds, have missed the trial, because of the
abundance of the consolation.</p>

<p>Such, my reader, is the manner of our Jesus just
now. By and by He will display His power; He
will come forth as the Rider on the white horse; He
will unsheath His sword; He will make bare His
arm; He will avenge His people, and right their
wrongs forever. But now His sword is sheathed,
His arm covered. This is the time for making
known the deep love of His heart, not the power of
His arm, nor the sharpness of His sword. Are you
satisfied to have it so? Is Christ's sympathy enough
for your heart, even amid the keenest sorrow and
the most intense affliction? The restless heart, the
impatient spirit, the unmortified will, would lead one
to long for escape from the trial, the difficulty, or the
pressure; but this would never do. It would involve
incalculable loss. We must pass from form to form
in the school; but the Master accompanies us, and
the light of His countenance, and the tender sympathy
of His heart, sustain us under the most severe
exercises.</p>

<p>And, then, see what glory redounds to the name
of the Lord, when His people are enabled, by His
grace, to pass, triumphantly, through a trial! Read
Daniel iii. 26-28, and say where you could find
richer or rarer fruits of a faithful discipleship. The
king and all his nobles, who, just before, had been
wholly engrossed with the bewitching music and the
false worship, are now occupied with the amazing
fact that the fire, which had slain the mighty men,
had taken no effect whatever upon the worshippers
of the true God, save to consume their fetters and
let them walk free, in company with the Son of God.
"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of
the burning fiery furnace, and spake and said,
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, <span class="smcap">ye servants
of the most high God</span>, come forth and come
hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
came forth of the midst of the fire. And the princes,
governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors,
being gathered together, <i>saw these men</i>, upon
whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was
a hair of their head singed, neither were their
coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on
them."</p>

<p>Here, then, was a noble testimony&mdash;such a testimony
as would never have been rendered, had the
Lord, by a mere act of power, preserved His servants
from being cast into the furnace. Nebuchadnezzar
was furnished with a striking proof that his
furnace was no more to be dreaded than his image
was to be worshipped by "the servants of the most
high God." In a word, the enemy was confounded;
God was glorified; and His dear servants
brought forth unscathed from "the burning fiery
furnace." Precious fruits, these, of a faithful Nazariteship!</p>

<p>And, observe, further, the honor put upon our
Nazarites. "Then Nebuchadnezzar spake and
said, Blessed be <i>the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego</i>." Their names are intimately associated
with the God of Israel. This was a high honor.
They had identified themselves with the true God
when it was a matter of life and death to do so;
and, therefore, the true God identified Himself with
them, and led them forth into a large and wealthy
place. He set their feet upon a rock, and lifted
their heads up above all their enemies round about
them. How true it is that "them that honor me I
will honor!" And it is equally true that "they
that despise me shall be lightly esteemed." (1 Sam.
ii. 30.)</p>

<p>My beloved reader, have you found settled, divine
peace for your guilty conscience, in the perfected
atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ? Have you
simply taken God at His word? Have you set to
your seal that God is true? If so, you are a child
of God; your sins are <i>all</i> forgiven, and you are accepted
as righteous in Christ; heaven, with all its
untold glories, is before you; you are as sure of
being in the glory as Christ Himself, inasmuch as
you are united to Him.</p>

<p>Thus, everything is settled for you for time and
eternity, according to the very utmost desire of your
heart. Your need is met, your guilt removed, your
peace established, your title sure. You have nought
to do for yourself. All is divinely finished.</p>

<p>What remains? Just this: LIVE FOR CHRIST!
You are left here for "a little while," to occupy for
Him, and wait for His appearing. Oh! seek to be
faithful to your blessed Master. Be not discouraged
by the fragmentary state of everything around you.
Let the case of Daniel and his honored companions
encourage your heart to seek after an elevated
course here below. It is your privilege to enjoy as
much of companionship with the blessed Lord Jesus,
as if you were cast amid the palmy days of apostolic
testimony.</p>

<p>May the Holy Ghost enable the writer and the
reader of these lines to drink into the spirit&mdash;walk
in the footsteps&mdash;manifest the graces&mdash;and wait for
the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>

<h2>SIN IN THE FLESH</h2>

<h3>AND</h3>

<h2>SIN ON THE CONSCIENCE</h2>


<p>It is of the utmost importance that we accurately
distinguish between sin <i>in the flesh</i>, and sin <i>on
the conscience</i>. If we confound these two, our souls
must necessarily be unhinged, and our worship
marred. An attentive consideration of 1 John i. 8-10.
will throw much light upon this subject, the understanding
of which is so essential.</p>

<p>There is no one who will be so conscious of indwelling
sin, as the man who walks in the light.
"If we say that we have <i>no sin</i>, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us." In the verse
immediately preceding, we read, "the blood of Jesus
Christ His Son cleanseth us from <i>all sin</i>." Here
the distinction between sin <i>in</i> us, and sin <i>on</i> us, is
fully brought out and established. To say that
there is sin on the believer, in the presence of God,
is to call in question the purging efficacy of the
blood of Jesus, and to deny the truth of the divine
record. If the blood of Jesus can perfectly purge,
then the believer's conscience is perfectly purged.
The word of God thus puts the matter; and we
must ever remember that it is from God Himself we
are to learn what the true condition of the believer
is, in His sight. We are more disposed to be occupied
in telling God what we are in ourselves, than
to allow Him to tell us what we are in Christ. In
other words, we are more taken up with our own
self-consciousness, than with God's revelation of
Himself. God speaks to us on the ground of what
He is in Himself, and of what He has accomplished
in Christ. Such is the nature and character of His
revelation, of which faith takes hold, and thus fills
the soul with perfect peace. God's revelation is
one thing; my consciousness is quite another.</p>

<p>But the same word which tells us we have no sin
<i>on</i> us, tells us, with equal force and clearness, that
we have sin <i>in</i> us. "If we say we have no sin, we
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." Every
one who has "truth" in him, will know that he
has "<i>sin</i>" in him, likewise; for truth reveals everything
as it is. What, then, are we to do? It is our
privilege so to walk in the power of the new nature
(that is, the Holy Ghost), that the "<i>sin</i>" which
dwells in us may not manifest itself in the form of
"<i>sins</i>." The Christian's position is one of victory
and liberty. He is not only delivered from the
guilt of sin, but also from sin as a ruling principle
in his life. "Knowing this, that our old man is
crucified with him, that the body of sin might be
destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
For he that is dead is freed from sin ... let not
sin therefore <i>reign</i> in your mortal body, that ye
should <i>obey</i> it in the lusts thereof.... For sin shall
not have dominion over you; for ye are not under
the law, but under grace." (Rom. vi. 6-14.) Sin is
there in all its native vileness, but the believer is
<i>dead</i> to it. How? He died in Christ. By nature
he was dead <i>in</i> sin. By grace he is dead <i>to</i> it.
What claim can anything or any one have upon a
dead man? None whatever. Christ "died unto
sin once," and the believer died in Him. "Now if
we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall
also live with Him; knowing that Christ, being
raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no
more dominion over Him. For in that He died, He
died unto sin once; but in that He liveth, He liveth
unto God." What is the result of this, in reference
to believers? "<i>Likewise</i> reckon ye also yourselves
to be <i>dead indeed unto sin</i>, but alive unto God
through Jesus Christ our Lord." Such is the believer's
unalterable position before God, so that it
is his holy privilege to enjoy freedom from sin as a
<i>ruler</i> over him, though it be a <i>dweller</i> in him.</p>

<p>But then, "if any man sin," what is to be done?
The inspired apostle furnishes a full and most
blessed answer: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness." (1 John i. 9.) Confession
is the mode in which the conscience is to be
kept free. The apostle does not say, "If we pray
for pardon, He is gracious and merciful to forgive
us." No doubt, it is ever happy for a child to
breathe the sense of need into his father's ear&mdash;to
tell him of feebleness, to confess folly, infirmity, and
failure. All this is most true; and, moreover, it is
equally true that our Father is most gracious and
merciful to meet His children in all their weakness
and ignorance; but, while all this is true, the Holy
Ghost declares, by the apostle, that "if we <i>confess</i>,"
God is "<i>faithful</i> and <i>just</i> to forgive." Confession
therefore is the divine mode. A Christian, having
erred in thought, word, or deed, might pray for
pardon for days and months together, and not
have any assurance, from 1 John i. 9, that he was
forgiven; whereas, the moment he truly confesses
his sin before God, it is a simple matter of faith to
know that he is perfectly forgiven, and perfectly
cleansed.</p>

<p>There is an immense moral difference between
praying for forgiveness, and confessing our sins,
whether we look at it in reference to the character
of God, the sacrifice of Christ, or the condition of
the soul. It is quite possible that a person's prayer
may involve the confession of his sin, whatever it
may happen to be, and thus come to the same
thing. But then, it is always well to keep close to
Scripture, in what we think, and say, and do. It
must be evident that when the Holy Ghost speaks
of <i>confession</i>, He does not mean <i>praying</i>. And it is
equally evident that He knows there are moral elements
in, and practical results flowing out of, confession,
which do not belong to prayer. In point
of fact, one has often found that a habit of importuning
God for the forgiveness of sins, displayed
ignorance as to the way in which God has revealed
Himself in the Person and work of Christ; as to
the relation in which the sacrifice of Christ has
set the believer; and as to the divine mode of getting
the conscience relieved from the burden, and
purified from the evil of sin.</p>

<p>God has been perfectly satisfied, as to all the believer's
sins, in the cross of Christ. On that cross
a full atonement was presented for every jot and
tittle of sin, in the believer's nature and on his conscience.
Hence, therefore, God does not need any
further propitiation. He does not need aught to
draw His heart toward the believer. We do not
require to supplicate Him to be "faithful and just,"
when His faithfulness and justice have been so gloriously
displayed, vindicated, and answered, in the
death of Christ. Our sins can never come into
God's presence, inasmuch as Christ, who bore them
all, and put them away, is there instead. But if we
sin, conscience will feel it, must feel it; yea, the Holy
Ghost will make us feel it. He cannot allow so much
as a single light thought to pass unjudged. What
then? Has our sin made its way into the presence
of God? Has it found its place in the unsullied
light of the inner sanctuary? God forbid! The
"Advocate" is there&mdash;"Jesus Christ the righteous"&mdash;to
maintain, in unbroken integrity, the relationship
in which we stand. But though sin cannot
affect God's thoughts in reference to us, it can, and
does affect our thoughts in reference to Him.
Though it cannot make its way into God's presence,
it can make its way into ours, in a most distressing
and humiliating manner. Though it cannot hide
the Advocate from God's view, it can hide Him
from ours. It gathers, like a thick dark cloud, on
our spiritual horizon, so that our souls cannot bask
in the blessed beams of our Father's countenance.
It cannot affect our relationship with God, but it
can very seriously affect our enjoyment thereof.
What, therefore, are we to do? The Word answers,
"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
By confession, we get our conscience
cleared; the sweet sense of our relationship restored;
the dark cloud dispersed; the chilling, withering
influence removed; our thoughts of God set
straight. Such is the divine method; and we may
truly say that the heart that knows what it is to
have ever been in the place of confession, will feel
the divine power of the apostle's words, "My little
children, these things write I unto you, <i>that ye sin
not</i>." (1 John ii. 1.)</p>

<p>Then, again, there is a style of praying for forgiveness
which involves a losing sight of the perfect
ground of forgiveness, which has been laid in
the sacrifice of the cross. If God forgives sins, He
must be "faithful and just" in so doing. But it is
quite clear that our prayers, be they ever so sincere
and earnest, could not form the basis of God's faithfulness
and justice in forgiving us our sins. Nought
save the work of the cross could do this. There
the faithfulness and justice of God have had their
fullest establishment, and that, too, in immediate
reference to our actual sins, as well as to the root
thereof, in our nature. God has already judged
our sins, in the Person of our Substitute, "on the
tree;" and, in the act of confession, we judge ourselves.
This is essential to divine forgiveness and
restoration. The very smallest unconfessed, unjudged
sin, on the conscience, will entirely mar our
communion with God. Sin <i>in</i> us need not do this;
but if we suffer sin to remain <i>on</i> us, we cannot have
fellowship with God. He has put away our sins in
such a manner as that He can have us in His presence;
and so long as we abide in His presence, sin
does not trouble us. But if we get out of His presence,
and commit sin, our communion must of
necessity be suspended until, by confession, we have
got rid of the sin. All this, I need hardly add, is
founded exclusively upon the perfect sacrifice and
righteous advocacy of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Finally, as to the difference between prayer and
confession, as respects the condition of the heart
before God, and its moral sense of the hatefulness
of sin, it cannot possibly be overestimated. It is a
much easier thing to ask in a general way for the
forgiveness of our sins, than to confess those sins.
Confession involves <i>self-judgment</i>; asking for forgiveness
may not, and in itself does not. This
alone would be sufficient to point out the difference.
Self-judgment is one of the most valuable and
healthful exercises of the Christian life; and therefore
anything which produces it must be highly esteemed
by every earnest Christian.</p>

<p>The difference between asking for pardon, and
confessing the sin, is continually exemplified in dealing
with children. If a child has done anything
wrong, he finds much less difficulty in asking his
father to forgive him, than in openly and unreservedly
confessing the wrong. In asking for forgiveness,
the child may have in his mind a number of
things which tend to lessen the sense of the evil;
he may be secretly thinking that he was not so
much to blame after all, though, to be sure, it is only
proper to ask his father to forgive him; whereas, in
confessing the wrong, there is just one thing, and
that is self-judgment. Further, in asking for
forgiveness, the child may be influenced mainly by a
desire to escape the consequences of his wrong;
whereas a judicious parent will seek to produce a
just sense of its moral evil, which can only exist
where there is the full confession of the fault in
connection with self-judgment.</p>

<p>Thus it is in reference to God's dealing with His
children, when they do wrong. He must have the
whole thing brought out and thoroughly judged.
He will make us not only dread the consequences
of sin,&mdash;which are unutterable,&mdash;but hate the thing
itself, because of its hatefulness in His sight. Were
it possible for us, when we commit sin, to be forgiven
merely for the asking, our sense of sin, and
our shrinking from it, would not be nearly so intense;
and, as a consequence, our estimate of the
fellowship with which we are blessed would not be
nearly so high. The moral effect of all this upon
the general tone of our spiritual constitution, and
also upon our whole character and practical career,
must be obvious to every experienced Christian.</p>

<h2>GOD'S WAY, AND HOW TO FIND IT</h2>

<h3>(Read Job xxviii.; Luke xi. 34-36.)</h3>


<p>"There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and
which the vulture's eye hath not seen: the lion's
whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion
passed by it." What an unspeakable mercy for one
who really desires to walk with God, to know that
there is a way for him to walk in! God has prepared
a pathway for His redeemed in which they
may walk with all possible certainty, calmness and
fixedness. It is the privilege of every child of God,
and every servant of Christ, to be as sure that he is
in God's way as that his soul is saved. This may
seem a strong statement; but the question is, Is it
true? If it be true, it cannot be too strong. No
doubt it may, in the judgment of some, savor a little
of self-confidence and dogmatism to assert, in such
a day as that in which we live, and in the midst of
such a scene as that through which we are passing,
that we are sure of being in God's path. But what
saith the Scripture? It declares "there is a way,"
and it also tells us how to find and how to walk in
that way. Yes; the self-same voice that tells us of
God's salvation for our souls, tells us also of God's
pathway for our feet;&mdash;the very same authority that
assures us that "he that believeth on the Son of
God hath everlasting life," assures us also that
there is a way so plain that "the wayfaring men
though fools shall not err therein."</p>

<p>This, we repeat, is a signal mercy&mdash;a mercy at all
times, but especially in a day of confusion and perplexity
like the present. It is deeply affecting to
notice the state of uncertainty in which many of
God's dear people are found at the present moment.
We do not refer now to the question of salvation, of
this we have spoken largely elsewhere; but that
which we have now before us is the path of the
Christian&mdash;what he ought to do, where he should be
found, how he ought to carry himself in the midst of
the professing Church. Is it not too true that multitudes
of the Lord's people are at sea as to these
things? Are there not many who, were they to tell
out the real feelings of their hearts, would have to
own themselves in a thoroughly unsettled state&mdash;to
confess that they know not what to do, or where to
go, or what to believe? Now, the question is,
Would God leave His children, would Christ leave
His servants, in such darkness and confusion?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No; my dear Lord, in following Thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not in dark uncertainty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This foot obedient moves."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>May not a child know the will of his father? May
not a servant know the will of his master? And if
this be so in our earthly relationships, how much
more fully may we count upon it in reference to our
Father and Master in heaven. When Israel of old
emerged from the Red Sea, and stood upon the
margin of that great and terrible wilderness which
lay between them and the land of promise, how
were they to know their way? The trackless sand
of the desert lay all around them. It was in vain to
look for any footprint there. It was a dreary waste
in which the vulture's eye could not discern a
pathway. Moses felt this when he said to Hobab,
"Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness,
and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes." (Numb.
x. 31.) How well our poor unbelieving hearts can
understand this touching appeal! How one craves
a human guide in the midst of a scene of perplexity!
How fondly the heart clings to one whom we deem
competent to give us guidance in moments of darkness
and difficulty!</p>

<p>And yet, we may ask, what did Moses want with
Hobab's eyes? Had not Jehovah graciously undertaken
to be their guide? Yes, truly; for we are
told that "on the day that the tabernacle was reared
up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the
tent of the testimony; and at even, there was upon
the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire,
until the morning. So it was alway: the cloud
covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by
night. And when the cloud was taken up from the
tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel
journeyed; and in the place where the cloud abode,
there the children of Israel pitched their tents. At
the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel
journeyed, and at the commandment of the Lord
they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the
tabernacle, they rested in their tents. And when
the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many
days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of
the Lord, and journeyed not. And so it was, when
the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according
to the commandment of the Lord they abode
in their tents, and according to the commandment
the Lord, and journeyed not. And so it was, when
the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and
that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then
they journeyed; whether it was by day or by night
that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed; or
whether it were two days, or a month, or a year,
that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining
thereon, the children of Israel abode in their
tents and journeyed not, but when it was taken up
they journeyed. At the commandment of the Lord
they rested in their tents, and at the commandment
of the Lord they journeyed: they kept the charge of
the Lord at the commandment of the Lord by the
hand of Moses" (Num. ix. 15-23).</p>

<p>Here was divine guidance&mdash;a guidance, we may
surely say, quite sufficient to render them independent
of their own eyes, of Hobab's eyes, and the
eyes of any other mortal. It is interesting to note
that in the opening of the book of Numbers, it was
arranged that the ark of the covenant was to find its
place in the very bosom of the congregation; but
in chapter x. we are told that when "they departed
from the mount of the Lord three days' journey, the
ark of the covenant of the Lord <i>went before them</i>, in
the three days' journey, to search out a resting-place
for them." Instead of Jehovah finding a resting-place
in the bosom of His redeemed people, He becomes
their traveling Guide, and goes before them
to seek out a resting-place for them. What touching
grace is here! and what faithfulness! If Moses
will ask Hobab to be their guide, and that, too, in
the very face of God's provision&mdash;even the cloud
and the silver trumpet, then will Jehovah leave His
place in the centre of the tribes, and go before them
to search them out a resting-place. And did not He
know the wilderness well? Would not He be better
for them than ten thousand Hobabs? Might they
not fully trust Him? Assuredly. He would not
lead them astray. If His grace had redeemed them
from Egypt's bondage, and conducted them through
the Red Sea, surely they might confide in the same
grace to guide them across that great and terrible
wilderness, and bring them safely into the land flowing
with milk and honey.</p>

<p>But it must be borne in mind that, in order to
profit by divine guidance, there must be the abandonment
of our own will, and of all confidence in
our own reasonings, as well as all confidence in the
thoughts and reasonings of others. If I have Jehovah
as my Guide, I do not want my own eyes or the
eyes of a Hobab either. God is sufficient: I can
trust Him. He knows all the way across the desert;
and hence, if I keep my eye upon Him, I shall be
guided aright.</p>

<p>But this leads us on to the second division of our
subject, namely, How am I to find God's way? An
all-important question, surely. Whither am I to
turn to find God's pathway? If the vulture's eye,
so keen, so powerful, so far-seeing, hath not seen
it,&mdash;if the young lion, so vigorous in movement, so
majestic in mien, hath not trodden it,&mdash;if man
knoweth not the price of it, and if it is not to be
found in the land of the living,&mdash;if the depth saith,
It is not in me, and the sea saith, It is not with me,&mdash;if
it cannot be gotten for gold or precious stones,&mdash;if
the wealth of the universe cannot equal it, and
no wit of man discover it,&mdash;then whither am I to
turn? where shall I find it? Shall I turn to those
great standards of orthodoxy which rule the religious
thought and feeling of millions throughout the
length and breadth of the professing Church? Is
this wondrous pathway of wisdom to be found with
them? Do they form any exception to the great,
broad, sweeping rule of Job xxviii? Assuredly not.
What, then, am I to do? I know there is a way.
God, who cannot lie, declares this, and I believe it;
but where am I to find it? "Whence, then, cometh
wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept
close from the fowls of the air. Destruction and
Death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our
ears." Does it not seem like a hopeless case for
any poor ignorant mortal to search for this wondrous
pathway? No, blessed be God, it is by no means
a hopeless case, for "He understandeth the way
thereof, and He knoweth the place thereof. For He
looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the
whole heaven; to make the weight for the winds;
and He weigheth the waters by measure. When He
made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning
of the thunder, then did He see it and <i>declare</i>
it; He prepared it, yea, and searched it out. And
unto man He said, 'Behold, <i>the fear of the Lord</i>,
that is wisdom; and <i>to depart from evil</i> is understanding.'"</p>

<p>Here, then, is the divine secret of wisdom: "The
fear of the Lord." This sets the conscience directly
in the presence of God, which is its only true place.
The object of Satan is to keep the conscience out of
this place&mdash;to bring it under the power and authority
of man&mdash;to lead it into subjection to the commandments
and doctrines of men&mdash;to thrust in
something between the conscience and the authority
of Christ the Lord, it matters not what it is; it may
be a creed or a confession containing a quantity of
truth,&mdash;it may be the opinion of a man or a set of
men&mdash;the judgment of some favorite teacher,&mdash;anything,
in short, to come in and usurp, in the heart,
the place which belongs to God's Word alone. This
is a terrible snare, and a stumbling-block&mdash;a most
serious hindrance to our progress in the ways of the
Lord. God's Word must rule me&mdash;God's pure and
simple Word, not man's interpretation thereof. No
doubt, God may use a man to unfold that Word to
my soul; but then it is not man's unfolding of
God's Word that rules me, but God's Word by man
unfolded. This is of all importance. We must be
exclusively taught and exclusively governed by the
Word of the living God. Nothing else will keep us
straight, or give solidity and consistency to our
character and course as Christians. There is a
strong tendency within and around us to be ruled
by the thoughts and opinions of men&mdash;by those
great standards of doctrine which men have set up.
Those standards and opinions may have a large
amount of truth in them&mdash;they may be all true so
far as they go; that is not the point in question
now. What we want to impress upon the Christian
reader is, that he is not to be governed by the
thoughts of his fellow-man, but simply and solely by
the Word of God. It is of no value to hold a truth
from man; I must hold it directly from God Himself.
God may use a man to communicate His
truth; but unless I hold it as from God, it has no
divine power over my heart and conscience; it does
not bring me into living contact with God, but actually
hinders that contact by bringing in something
between my soul and His holy authority.</p>

<p>We should greatly like to enlarge upon and enforce
this great principle; but we must forbear, just
now, in order to unfold to the reader one or two
solemn and practical points set forth in the eleventh
chapter of Luke,&mdash;points which, if entered into,
will enable us to understand a little better how to
find God's way. We shall quote the passage at
length.&mdash;"The light of the body is the eye: therefore
when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is
full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body
also is full of darkness. Take heed, therefore, that
the light which is in thee be not darkness. If thy
whole body therefore be full of light, having no part
dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the
bright shining of a candle doth give thee light."</p>

<p>Here, then, we are furnished with the true secret
of discerning God's way. It may seem very difficult,
in the midst of the troubled sea of christendom,
to steer one's course aright. So many conflicting
voices fall on the ear. So many opposing views
solicit our attention, men of God differ so in judgment,
shades of opinion are so multiplied, that it
seems impossible to reach a sound conclusion. We
go to one man who, so far as we can judge, seems
to have a single eye, and he tells us one thing; we
go to another man who also seems to have a single
eye, and he tells the very reverse. What, then, are
we to think? Well, one thing is certain, that our
own eye is not single when we are running, in uncertainty
and perplexity, from one man to another.
The single eye is fixed on Christ alone, and thus the
body is filled with light. The Israelite of old had
not to run hither and thither to consult with his
fellow as to the right way. Each had the same
divine guide, namely, the pillar of cloud by day,
and the pillar of fire by night. In a word, Jehovah
Himself was the infallible Guide of each member of
the congregation. They were not left to the guidance
of the most intelligent, sagacious, or experienced
man in the assembly; neither were they left
to follow their own way,&mdash;each was to follow the
Lord. The silver trumpet announced to all alike
the mind of God; and no one whose ear was open
and attentive was left at any loss. The eye and the
ear of each were to be directed to God <i>alone</i>, and
not to a fellow-mortal. This was the secret of guidance
in the trackless desert of old, and this is the
secret of guidance in the vast moral wilderness
through which God's redeemed are passing now.
One man may say, Listen to me; and another may
say, Listen to me; and a third may say, Let each
one take his own way. The obedient heart says, in
opposition to all, I must follow my Lord.</p>

<p>This makes all so simple. It will not, by any
means, tender to foster a spirit of haughty independence;
quite the reverse. The more I am taught
to lean on God alone for guidance, the more I shall
distrust and look off from myself; and this, assuredly,
is not independence. True, it will deliver me
from servile following of any man, by giving me to
feel my responsibility to Christ alone; but this is
precisely what is so much needed at the present
moment. The more closely we examine the elements
that are abroad in the professing Church, the more
we shall be convinced of our personal need of this
entire subjection to divine authority, which is only
another name for "the fear of the Lord," or, "a
single eye." There is one brief sentence, in the
opening of the Acts of the Apostles, which furnishes
a perfect antidote to the self-will and the servile fear
of man so rife around us, and that is, "We must
obey God." What an utterance! "We must
<i>obey</i>." This is the cure for self-will. "We must
obey <i>God</i>." This is the cure for servile subjection
to the commandments and doctrines of men. There
must be obedience; but obedience to what? To
God's authority, and to that alone. Thus the soul
is preserved from the influence of infidelity on the
one hand, and superstition on the other. Infidelity
says, Do as you like. Superstition says, Do as man
tells you. Faith says, "We must obey God."</p>

<p>Here is the holy balance of the soul in the midst
of the conflicting and confounding influences around
us in this our day. As a servant, I am to obey my
Lord; as a child, I am to hearken to my Father's
commandments. Nor am I the less to do this although
my fellow-servants and my brethren may not
understand me. I must remember that the immediate
business of my soul is with God Himself.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He before whom the elders bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Him is <i>all</i> my business now."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is my privilege to be as sure that I have my Master's
mind as to my path as that I have His Word
for the security of my soul. If not, where am I?
Is it not my privilege to have a single eye? Yes,
surely. And what then? "A body full of light."
Now, if my body is full of light, can my mind be
full of perplexity? Impossible. The two things
are wholly incompatible; and hence, when one is
plunged "in dark uncertainty," it is very plain his
eye is not single. He may seem very sincere, he
may be very anxious to be guided aright; but he
may rest assured there is the lack of a single eye&mdash;that
indispensable prerequisite to divine guidance.
The Word is plain,&mdash;"If thine eye is single, thy
whole body also is full of light." God will ever
guide the obedient, humble soul; but, on the other
hand, if we do not walk according to the light communicated,
we shall get into darkness. Light not
acted upon becomes darkness, and oh, "how great
is that darkness!" Nothing is more dangerous than
tampering with the light which God gives. It must,
sooner or later, lead to the most disastrous consequences.
"Take heed, therefore, that the light
which is in thee be not darkness." "Hear, ye, and
give ear: be not proud; for the Lord hath spoken.
Give glory to the Lord your God, before <i>He</i> cause
darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark
mountains, and while ye look for light, <i>He</i> turn it
into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness."
(Jer. xiii. 15, 16.)</p>

<p>This is deeply solemn. What a contrast between
a man having a single eye, and a man not acting
on the light which God has given him! The one
has his body full of light; the other has his body
full of darkness: the one has no part dark; the
other is plunged in gross darkness: the one is a
light-bearer for others; the other is a stumbling-block
in the way. We know nothing more solemn
than the judicial acting of God, in actually turning
our light into darkness, because we have refused to
act on the light which He has been pleased to impart.</p>

<p>Christian reader, art thou acting up to thy light?
Has God sent a ray of light into thy soul? Has He
shown thee something wrong in thy ways or associations?
Art thou persisting in any line of action
which conscience tells thee is not in full accordance
with thy Master's will? Search and see. "Give
glory to the Lord thy God." Act on the light. Do
not hesitate. Think not of consequences. Obey,
we beseech thee, the word of thy Lord. This very
moment, as thine eye scans these lines, let the purpose
of thy soul be to depart from iniquity wherever
thou findest it. Say not, Whither shall I go? What
shall I do next? There is evil everywhere. It is
only escaping from one evil to plunge into another.
Say not these things; do not argue or reason; do
not look at results; think not of what the world or
the world-church will say of thee; rise above all
these things, and tread the path of light&mdash;that path
which shineth more and more unto the perfect day
of glory. Remember, God never gives light for two
steps at a time. If He has given thee light for one
step, then, in the fear and love of His Name, take
that one step, and thou wilt assuredly get more light&mdash;yes,
"more and more." But if there be the refusal
to act, the light which is in thee will become
gross darkness, thy feet will stumble on the dark
mountains of error which lie on either side of the
straight and narrow path of obedience; and thou
wilt become a stumbling-block in the path of others.
Some of the most grievous stumbling-blocks that
lie, at this moment, in the pathway of anxious inquirers
are found in the persons of those who once
seemed to possess the truth, but have turned from
it. The light which was in them has become darkness,
and oh, how great and how appalling is that
darkness! How sad it is to see those who ought to
be light-bearers, acting as a positive hindrance to
young and earnest Christians! But let not young
Christians be hindered by them. The way is plain.
"The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart
from evil is understanding." Let each one
hear and obey for himself the voice of the Lord.
"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and
they follow Me." The Lord be praised for this
precious word! It puts each one in the place of
direct responsibility to Christ Himself; it tells us
plainly what is <i>God's way</i>, and, just as plainly, <i>how
to find it</i>.</p>

<h2>THE UNEQUAL YOKE</h2>


<p>No one who sincerely desires to attain, in his own
person, or promote in others, a purer and more
elevated discipleship, can possibly contemplate the
Christianity of the present day without an indescribable
feeling of sadness and heaviness. Its tone is so
excessively low, its aspect so sickly, and its spirit
so enfeebled, that one is, at times, tempted to despair
of any thing like a true and faithful witness
for an absent Lord. All this is the more truly deplorable
when we remember the commanding motives
by which it is our special privilege ever to be
actuated. Whether we look at the Master whom we
are called to follow, the path which we are called to
tread, the end which we are called to keep in view,
or the hopes by which we are to be animated, we
cannot but own that, were all these entered into
and realized by a more simple faith, we should assuredly
exhibit a more ardent discipleship. "The
love of Christ," says the apostle, "constraineth us."
This is the most powerful motive of all. The more
the heart is filled with Christ's love, and the eye
filled with His blessed person, the more closely shall
we seek to follow in His heavenly track. His footmarks
can only be discovered by "a single eye;"
and unless the will is broken, the flesh mortified,
and the body kept under, we shall utterly fail in our
discipleship, and make shipwreck of faith and a good
conscience.</p>

<p>Let not my reader misunderstand me. It is not
here, by any means, a question of personal salvation.
It is quite another thing. Nothing can be more
basely selfish than, having received salvation as the
fruit of Christ's agony and bloody sweat, His cross
and passion, to keep at as great a distance from His
sacred person as we can without forfeiting our personal
safety. This is, even in the judgment of
nature, deemed a character of selfishness worthy of
unmingled contempt; but when exhibited by one who
professes to owe his present and his everlasting
all to a rejected, crucified, risen, and absent, Master,
no language can express its moral baseness.
"Provided I escape hell-fire, it makes little matter
as to discipleship." Reader, do you not, in your
inmost soul, abhor this sentiment? If so, then
earnestly seek to flee from it, to the very opposite
point of the compass; and let your truthful language
be, Provided that blessed Master is glorified,
it makes little matter, comparatively, about my personal
safety. Would to God that this were the sincere
utterance of many hearts in this day, when,
alas, it may be too truly said that, "All seek their
own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's" (Phil.
ii. 21). Would that the Holy Ghost would raise up,
by His own resistless power, and send forth, by His
own heavenly energy, a band of separated and
consecrated followers of the Lamb, each one bound,
by the cords of love, to the horns of the altar&mdash;a
company, like Gideon's three hundred of old, able
to confide in God and deny the flesh. How the
heart longs for this! How the spirit, bowed down
at times beneath the chilling and withering influence
of a cold and uninfluential profession, earnestly
breathes after a more vigorous and whole-hearted
testimony for that One who emptied Himself and
laid aside His glory, in order that we, through His
precious bloodshedding, might be raised to companionship
with Him in eternal blessedness!</p>

<p>Now, amongst the numerous hindrances to this
thorough consecration of heart to Christ which I
earnestly desire for myself and my reader, "the
unequal yoke" will be found to occupy a very prominent
place indeed. "Be ye not unequally yoked together
[&#949;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#950;&#965;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;] with unbelievers: for what
partnership [&#956;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#967;&#951;] hath righteousness with unrighteousness
[or rather lawlessness&mdash;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#945;]? and
what communion [&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#945;] hath light with darkness?
And what concord hath Christ with Belial?
or what part hath a believer with an unbeliever
[&#945;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#965;]? And what agreement hath the temple
of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living
God; as God hath said, 'I will dwell in them,
and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they
shall be My people.' 'Wherefore come out from
among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord,
and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive
you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be
My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.'"
(2 Cor. vi. 14-18.)</p>

<p>Under the Mosaic economy, we learn the same
moral principle.&mdash;"Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard
with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which
thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be
defiled. Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass
together. Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers
sorts, as of woolen and linen together." (Deut.
xxii. 9-11; Lev. xix. 19.)</p>

<p>These scriptures will suffice to set forth the moral
evil of an unequal yoke. It may, with full confidence,
be asserted that no one can be an unshackled
follower of Christ who is, in any way, "unequally
yoked." He may be a saved person, he may be a
true child of God&mdash;a sincere believer, but he cannot
be a thorough disciple; and not only so, but there
is a positive hindrance to the full manifestation of
that which he may really be, notwithstanding his
unequal yoke. "Come out, ... and I will receive
you, ... and ye shall be my sons and daughters,
saith the Lord Almighty." That is to say, Get
your neck out of the unequal yoke, and I will receive
you, and there shall be the full, public, practical
manifestation of your relationship with the Lord
Almighty. The idea here is evidently different from
that set forth in James&mdash;"Of His own will begat He
us, by the word of truth." And also in Peter&mdash;"Being
born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and
abideth forever." And again in 1 John&mdash;"Behold
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon
us, that we should be called the sons of God." So
also in John's gospel&mdash;"But as many as received
Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of
God, even to them that believe on His name; which
were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
nor of the will of man, but of God." In all these
passages, the relationship of sons is founded upon
the divine counsel and the divine operation, and is
not set before us as the consequence of any acting
of ours; whereas in 2 Corinthians vi. it is put as
the result of our getting out of the unequal yoke.
In other words, it is entirely a practical question.
Thus in Matthew v. we read, "But I say unto you,
'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
despitefully use you, and persecute you; in order
that [&#959;&#960;&#969;&#962;] ye may be the sons of your Father
which is in heaven; because He causeth His sun to
rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain
upon the just and the unjust." Here too it is the
practical establishment and public declaration of the
relationship, and its moral influence. It becomes
the sons of such a Father to act in such a way. In
short, we have the abstract position or relationship
of sons founded on God's sovereign will and operation;
and we have the moral character consequent
upon and flowing out of this relationship which
affords just ground for God's public acknowledgment
thereof. God cannot fully and publicly own
those who are unequally yoked together with unbelievers,
for, were He to do so, it would be an acknowledgment
of the unequal yoke. He cannot
acknowledge "darkness," "unrighteousness," "Belial,"
"idols," and "an infidel." How could He?
Hence, if I yoke myself with any of these, I am
morally and publicly identified with them, and not
with God at all. I have put myself into a position
which God cannot own, and, as a consequence, He
cannot own me; but if I withdraw myself from that
position&mdash;if I "come out and be separate"&mdash;if
I take my neck out of the unequal yoke&mdash;then, but
not until then, can I be publicly and fully received
and owned as a "son or daughter of the Lord Almighty."</p>

<p>This is a solemn and searching principle for all
who feel that they have unhappily gotten themselves
into such a yoke. They are not walking as disciples,
nor are they publicly or morally on the ground of
sons. God cannot own them. Their secret relationship
is not the point; but they have put themselves
thoroughly off God's ground. They have
foolishly thrust their neck into a yoke which, inasmuch
as it is not Christ's yoke, must be Belial's
yoke; and until they cast off that yoke, God cannot
own them as His sons and daughters. God's grace,
no doubt, is infinite, and can meet us in all our
failure and weakness; but if our souls aspire after a
higher order of discipleship, we must at once cast
off the unequal yoke, cost what it may; that is, if
it can be cast off; but if it cannot, we must only
bow our heads beneath the shame and sorrow thereof,
looking to God for full deliverance.</p>

<p>Now, there are four distinct phases in which "the
unequal yoke" may be contemplated, viz, the domestic,
the commercial, the religious, and the philanthropic.
Some may be disposed to confine 2 Corinthians
vi. 14 to the first of these; but the apostle
does not so confine it. The words are, "Be not unequally
yoked together with unbelievers." He does
not specify the character or object of the yoke, and
therefore we are warranted in giving the passage its
widest application, by bringing its edge to bear
directly upon every phase of the unequal yoke; and
we shall see the importance of so doing ere we
close these remarks, if the Lord permit.</p>

<p>I. And first, then, let us consider the domestic or
marriage yoke. What pen can portray the mental
anguish, the moral misery, together with the ruinous
consequences as to spiritual life and testimony,
flowing from a Christian's marriage with an unconverted
person? I suppose nothing can be more deplorable
than the condition of one who discovers,
when it is too late, that he has linked himself for
life with one who cannot have a single thought or
feeling in common with him. One desires to serve
Christ; the other can only serve the devil: one
breathes after the things of God; the other sighs
for the things of this present world: the one earnestly
seeks to mortify the flesh, with all its affections
and desires; the other only seeks to minister to and
gratify these very things. Like a sheep and a goat
linked together, the sheep longs to feed on the green
pasture in the field, while, on the other hand, the
goat craves the brambles which grow in the ditch.
The sad consequence is that both are starved. One
<i>will</i> not feed on the pasture, and the other <i>cannot</i>
feed upon the brambles, and thus neither gets what
his nature craves, unless the goat, by superior
strength, succeeds in forcing his unequally yoked
companion to remain among the brambles, there to
languish and die.</p>

<p>The moral of this is plain enough; and, moreover,
it is, alas! of but too common occurrence. The
goat generally succeeds in gaining his end. The
worldly partner carries his or her point, in almost
every instance. It will be found, almost without exception,
that in cases of the unequal marriage-yoke,
the poor Christian is the sufferer, as is evidenced
by the bitter fruits of a bad conscience, a depressed
heart, a gloomy spirit, and a desponding mind. A
heavy price, surely, to pay for the gratification of
some natural affection, or the attainment, it may be,
of some paltry worldly advantage. In fact, a marriage
of this kind is the death-knell of practical
Christianity, and of progress in the divine life. It
is morally impossible that any one can be an unfettered
disciple of Christ with his neck in the marriage-yoke
with an unbeliever. As well might a
racer in the Olympic or Isthmæan games have expected
to gain the crown of victory by attaching
a heavy weight or dead body to his person. It is
enough, surely, to have one dead body to sustain,
without attaching another. There never was a true
Christian yet who did not find that he had abundant
work to do in endeavoring to grapple with the evils
of <i>one</i> heart, without going to burden himself with
the evils of two; and, without doubt, the man who
foolishly and disobediently marries an unconverted
woman; or the woman who marries an unconverted
man, is burdened with the combined evils of two
hearts; and who is sufficient for these things? One
can most fully count upon the grace of Christ for
the subjugation of his own evil nature: but he certainly
cannot count, in the same way, upon that
grace in reference to the evil nature of his unequal
yoke-fellow. If he have yoked himself ignorantly,
the Lord will meet him personally, on the ground of
full confession, with entire restoration of soul, but
in the matter of his discipleship, he will never recover
it.</p>

<p>Now, in considering the terribly evil consequences
of the unequal marriage-yoke, it is mainly as bearing
upon our discipleship that we are looking at
them. I say "mainly" because our entire character
and experience are deeply affected thereby. I very
much question if any one can give a more effectual
blow to his prosperity in the divine life than by assuming
an unequal yoke. Indeed, the very fact of
so doing proves that spiritual decline has already
set in, with most alarming symptoms; but as to his
discipleship and testimony, the lamp thereof may be
regarded as all but gone out; or if it does give an
occasional faint glimmer, it only serves to make
manifest the awful gloom of his unhappy position,
and the appalling consequences of being "unequally
yoked together with an unbeliever."</p>

<p>Thus much as to the question of the unequal yoke
in its influence upon the life, the character, the testimony,
and the discipleship of the child of God.</p>

<p>I would now say a word as to its moral effect as
exhibited in the domestic circle. Here too the consequences
are truly melancholy. Nor could they
possibly be otherwise. Two persons have come together
in the closest and most intimate relationship,
with tastes, habits, feelings, desires, tendencies,
and objects diametrically opposite. They have
nothing in common; so that in every movement
they can but grate one against the other. The unbeliever
cannot, <i>in reality</i>, go with the believer; and
if there should, through excessive amiability or
downright hypocrisy, be a show of acquiesence,
what is it worth in the sight of the Lord, who judges
the true state of the heart in reference to Himself?
But little indeed; yea, it is worse than worthless.
Then, again, if the believer should unhappily go in
any measure with his unequal yoke-fellow, it can
only be at the expense of his discipleship, and the
consequence is, a condemning conscience in the
sight of the Lord; and this, again, leads to heaviness
of spirit, and, it may be, sourness of temper
in the domestic circle, so that the grace of the
gospel is by no means commended, and the unbeliever
is not attracted or won. Thus it is in every
way most sorrowful. It is dishonoring to God, destructive
of spiritual prosperity, utterly subversive
of discipleship and testimony, and entirely hostile
to domestic peace and blessing. It produces estrangement,
coldness, distance, and misunderstanding:
or, if it does not produce these, it will doubtless
lead, on the part of the Christian, to a forfeiture
of his discipleship and his good conscience, both of
which he may be tempted to offer as a sacrifice upon
the altar of domestic peace. Thus, whatever way
we look at it, an unequal yoke must lead to the most
deplorable consequences.</p>

<p>Then, as to its effect upon children, it is equally
sad. These are almost sure to flow in the current
with the unconverted parent. "Their children spoke
half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak
in the Jews' language, but according to the language
of each people." There can be no union of heart
in the training of the children,&mdash;no joint and mutual
confidence in reference to them. One desires to
bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord; the other desires to bring them up in the
principles of the world, the flesh, and the devil: and
as all the sympathies of the children, as they grow up,
are likely to be ranged on the side of the latter, it is
easy to see how it will end. In short, it is an unseemly,
unscriptural, and vain effort to plow with
an "unequal yoke," or to "sow the ground with
mingled seed;" and all must end in sorrow and
confusion.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>I shall, ere turning from this branch of our subject,
offer a remark as to the reasons which generally
actuate Christians in the matter of entering into the
unequal marriage-yoke. We all know, alas! how
easily the poor heart persuades itself of the rightness
of any step which it desires to take, and how
the devil furnishes plausible arguments to convince
us of its rightness&mdash;arguments which the moral
condition of the soul causes us to regard as clear,
forcible, and satisfactory. The very fact of our
thinking of such a thing, proves our unfitness to
weigh, with a well-balanced mind and spiritually
adjusted conscience, the solemn consequences of
such a step. If the eye were single (that is, if we
were governed but by one object, namely, the glory
and honor of the Lord Jesus Christ), we should never
entertain the idea of putting our necks in an unequal
yoke; and consequently we should have no
difficulty or perplexity about the matter. A racer,
whose eye was resting on the crown, would not be
troubled with any perplexity as to whether he ought
to stop and tie a hundred-weight round his neck.
Such a thought would never cross his mind: and
not only so, but a thorough racer would have a
distinct and almost intuitive perception of every
thing which would be likely to prove a hindrance to
him in running the race; and, of course, with such an
one, to perceive would be to reject with decision.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Now, were it thus with Christians in the matter of
unscriptural marriage, it would save them a world of
sorrow and perplexity; but it is not thus. The heart
gets out of communion, and is morally incompetent
to "try the things that differ;" and when in this
condition, the devil gains an easy conquest, and
speedy success in his wicked effort to induce the believer
to yoke himself with "Belial"&mdash;with "unrighteousness"&mdash;with
"darkness"&mdash;with "an infidel."
When the soul is in full communion with God, it is
entirely subject to His Word; it sees things as He
sees them, calls them what He calls them, and not
what the devil or his own carnal heart would call
them. In this way, the believer escapes the insnaring
influence of a deception which is very frequently
brought to bear upon him in this matter, namely, a
false profession of religion on the part of the person
whom he desires to marry. This is a very common
case. It is easy to show symptoms of leaning toward
the things of God; and the heart is treacherous and
base enough to make a profession of religion in
order to gain its end; and not only so, but the
devil, who is "transformed into an angel of light,"
will lead to this false profession, in order thereby
the more effectually to entrap the feet of a child
of God. Thus it comes to pass that Christians, in
this matter, suffer themselves to be satisfied, or at
least profess themselves satisfied, with evidence of
conversion which under any other circumstances
they would regard as utterly lame and flimsy.</p>

<p>But, alas! experience soon opens the eyes to the
<i>reality</i>. It is speedily discovered that the profession
was all a vain show, that the <i>heart</i> is entirely in and
of the world. Terrible discovery. Who can detail
the bitter consequences of such a discovery&mdash;the
anguish of heart&mdash;the bitter reproaches and cuttings
of conscience&mdash;the shame and confusion&mdash;the loss
of power and blessing&mdash;the forfeiture of spiritual
peace and joy&mdash;the sacrifice of a life of usefulness?
Who can describe all these things? The man awakes
from his delusive dream, and opens his eyes upon
the tremendous reality that he is yoked for life with
"Belial"! Yes, this is what the Spirit calls it. It
is not an inference, or a deduction arrived at by a
process of reasoning; but a plain and positive statement
of holy Scripture, that thus the matter stands
in reference to one who, from whatever motive, or
under the influence of whatever reasons, or deceived
by whatever false pretences, has entered into an
unequal marriage-yoke.</p>

<p>Oh, my beloved Christian reader, if you are in
danger of entering into such a yoke, let me earnestly,
solemnly, and affectionately entreat of you to
pause first, and weigh the matter in the balances of
the sanctuary, ere you move forward a single hair's
breadth on such a fatal path! You may rest assured
that you will no sooner have taken the step
than your heart will be assailed by hopeless regrets,
and your life embittered by unnumbered sorrows.
<span class="smcap">Let nothing induce you to yoke yourself with
an unbeliever.</span> Are your affections engaged?
Then, remember, they cannot be the affections of
your new man; they are, be assured of it, those of
the old or carnal nature, which you are called upon
to mortify and set aside. Wherefore you should
cry to God for spiritual power to rise above the influence
of such affections; yea, to sacrifice them to
Him. Again, are your interests concerned? Then
remember that they are only <i>your</i> interests; and if
they are promoted, Christ's interests are sacrificed
by your yoking yourself with "Belial." Furthermore,
they are only your temporal, and not your
eternal interests. In point of fact, the interests of
the believer and those of Christ ought to be identical;
and it is plain that His interests, His honor, His
truth, His glory, must inevitably be sacrificed if a
member of His body is linked with "Belial." This
is the true way to look at the question. What are
a few hundreds, or a few thousands, to an heir of
heaven? "God is able to give thee much more than
this." Are you going to sacrifice the truth of God,
as well as your own spiritual peace, prosperity, and
happiness, for a paltry trifle of gold, which must
perish in the using of it? Ah, no! God forbid!
Flee from it, as a bird from the snare which it sees
and knows. Stretch out the hand of genuine, well-braced,
whole-hearted discipleship, and take the
knife and slay your affections and your interests on
the altar of God, and then, even though there should
not be an audible voice from heaven to approve your
act, you will have the invaluable testimony of an
approving conscience and an ungrieved Spirit&mdash;an
ample reward, surely, for the most costly sacrifice
which you can make. May the Spirit of God give
power to resist Satan's temptations.</p>

<p>It is hardly needful to remark here that in cases
where conversion takes place after marriage, the
complexion of the matter is very materially altered.
There will then be no smitings of conscience, for
example, and the whole thing is modified in a variety
of particulars. Still, there will be difficulty, trial,
and sorrow, unquestionably. The only thing is, that
one can far more happily bring the trial and sorrow
into the Lord's presence, when he has not deliberately
and willfully plunged himself thereinto; and, blessed
be God, we know how ready He is to forgive, restore,
and cleanse from all unrighteousness the soul that
makes full confession of its error and failure. This
may comfort the heart of one who has been brought
to the Lord after marriage. Moreover, to such an
one the Spirit of God has given specific direction and
blessed encouragement in the following passage:
"If any brother have an unbelieving wife, and she
think proper to dwell with him, let him not put her
away: and if any woman have an unbelieving husband,
and he think proper to dwell with her, let her
not put him away (for the unbelieving husband is
sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is
sanctified by the husband, else were your children
unclean, but now are they holy).... For what
knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save thy husband?
or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou
shalt save thy wife?" (1 Cor. vii. 12-16.)</p>

<p>II. We shall now consider "the unequal yoke"
in its commercial phase, as seen in cases of partnership
in business. This, though not so serious an
aspect of the yoke as that which we have just been
considering, will nevertheless be found a very positive
barrier to the believer's testimony. When a
Christian yokes himself, for business purposes, with
an unbeliever&mdash;whether that unbeliever be a relative
or not&mdash;or when he becomes a member of a worldly
firm, he virtually surrenders his individual responsibility.
Henceforth the acts of the firm become his
acts, and it is perfectly out of the question to think
of getting a worldly firm to act on heavenly principles.
They would laugh at such a notion, inasmuch
as it would be an effectual barrier to the success of
their commercial schemes. They will feel perfectly
free to adopt a number of expedients in carrying on
their business which would be quite opposed to the
spirit and principles of the kingdom in which he is,
and of the Church of which he forms a part. Thus
he will find himself constantly in a most trying position.
He may use his influence to Christianize the
mode of conducting affairs, but they will compel
him to do business as others do, and he has no
remedy save to mourn in secret over his anomalous
and difficult position, or else to go out at great
pecuniary loss to himself and family. Where the
eye is single, there will be no hesitation as to which
of these alternatives to adopt; but, alas! the very
fact of getting into such a position proves the lack
of a single eye; and the fact of being in it argues
the lack of spiritual capacity to appreciate the value
and power of the divine principles which would infallibly
bring a man out of it. A man whose eye
was single could not possibly yoke himself with an
unbeliever for the purpose of making money. Such
an one could only set, as an object before his mind,
the direct glory of Christ; and this object could
never be gained by a positive transgression of divine
principle.</p>

<p>This makes it very simple. If it does not glorify
Christ for a Christian to become a partner in a
worldly firm, it must, without doubt, further the designs
of the devil. There is no middle ground; but
that it does not glorify Christ is manifest, for His
Word says, "Be not unequally yoked together with
unbelievers." Such is the principle, which cannot
be infringed without damage to the testimony, and
forfeiture of spiritual blessing. True, the conscience
of a Christian who transgresses in this matter may
seek relief in various ways&mdash;may have recourse to
various subterfuges&mdash;may set forth various arguments
to persuade itself that all is right. It will be
said that "we can be very devoted and very spiritual,
so far as we are personally concerned, even though
we are yoked, for business purposes, with an unbeliever."
This will be found fallacious when brought
to the test of the actual practice. A servant of Christ
will find himself hampered in a hundred ways by his
worldly partnership. If in matters of service to
Christ he is not met with open hostility, he will have
to encounter the enemy's secret and constant effort
to damp his ardor, and throw cold water on all his
schemes. He will be laughed at and despised&mdash;he
will be continually reminded of the effect which his
enthusiasm and fanaticism will produce in reference
to the business prospects of the firm. If he uses
his time, his talents, or his pecuniary resources in
what he believes to be the Lord's service, he will be
pronounced a fool or a madman, and reminded that
the true&mdash;the proper way for a commercial man to
serve the Lord is to "attend to business, and nothing
but business;" and that it is the exclusive business
of clergymen and ministers to attend to religious
matters, inasmuch as they are set apart and paid for
so doing.</p>

<p>Now, although the Christian's renewed mind may
be thoroughly convinced of the fallacy of all this
reasoning&mdash;although he may see that this worldly
wisdom is but a flimsy, threadbare cloak, thrown
over the heart's covetous practices&mdash;yet who can tell
how far the heart may be influenced by such things?
We get weary of constant resistance. The current
becomes too strong for us, and we gradually yield
ourselves to its action, and are carried along on its
surface. Conscience may have some death-struggles;
but the spiritual energies are paralyzed, and the sensibilities
of the new nature are blunted, so that there
is no response to the cries of conscience, and no
effectual effort to withstand the enemy; the worldliness
of the Christian's heart leagues itself with the
opposing influences from without&mdash;the outworks are
stormed, and the citadel of the soul's affections
vigorously assaulted; and finally, the man settles
down in thorough worldliness, exemplifying in his
own person the prophet's touching lament, "Her
Nazarites <i>were</i> purer than snow, they <i>were</i> whiter
than milk, they <i>were</i> more ruddy in body than rubies,
their polishing <i>was</i> of sapphire: their visage is
blacker than a coal; they <i>are</i> not known in the
streets; their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is
withered, it is become like a stick." (Lam. iv. 7, 8.)
The man who was once known as a servant of
Christ&mdash;a fellow-helper unto the kingdom of God&mdash;making
use of his resources only to further the interests
of the gospel of Christ, is now, alas! settled
down upon his lees, only known as a plodding, keen,
bargain-making man of business, of whom the apostle
might well say, "Demas hath forsaken me, having
loved this present age [&#964;&#959;&#957; &#957;&#965;&#957; &#945;&#953;&#969;&#957;&#945;]."</p>

<p>But perhaps nothing so operates on the hearts of
Christians, in inducing them to yoke themselves
commercially with unbelievers, as the habit of seeking
to maintain the two characters of a Christian
and a man of business. This is a grievous snare.
In point of fact, there can be no such thing. A man
must be either the one or the other. If I am a
Christian, my Christianity must show itself as a living
reality in that in which I am; and if it cannot show
itself there, I ought not to be there: for if I continue
in a sphere or position in which the life of
Christ cannot be manifested, I shall speedily possess
naught of Christianity but the name without
the reality&mdash;the outward form without the inward
power&mdash;the shell without the kernel. I should be
the servant of Christ, not merely on Sunday, but
from Monday morning to Saturday night. I should
not only be a servant of Christ in the public assembly,
but also in my place of business, whatever it
may happen to be. But I cannot be a proper servant
of Christ with my neck in the yoke with an unbeliever;
for how could the servants of two hostile
masters work in the same yoke? It is utterly
impossible; as well might one attempt to link the sun's
meridian beams with the profound darkness of midnight.
It cannot be done; and I do therefore most
solemnly appeal to my reader's conscience, in the
presence of Almighty God, who shall judge the
secrets of men's hearts by Jesus Christ, as to this
important matter. I would say to him, if he is
thinking of getting into partnership with an unbeliever,
<span class="smcap">Flee from it!</span> yes, flee from it, though it
promises you the gain of thousands. You will
plunge yourself into a mass of sorrow and trouble.
You are going to "plow" with one whose feelings,
instincts, and tendencies are diametrically opposed
to your own. "An ox and an ass" are not so unlike,
in every respect, as a believer and an unbeliever.
How will you ever get on? He wants to make money&mdash;to
profit himself&mdash;to get on in the world; you
want (at least you ought to want) to grow in grace
and holiness&mdash;to advance the interests of Christ and
His gospel on the earth, and to push onward to the
everlasting kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ. His
object is money; yours, I trust, is Christ: he lives
for this world; you, for the world to come; he is
engrossed with the things of time; you, with those
of eternity. How, then, can you ever take common
ground with him? Your principles, your motives,
your objects, your hopes, are all opposed. How is
it possible you can get on? How can you have aught
in common? Surely, all this needs only to be looked
at with a single eye in order to be seen in its true
light. It is impossible that any one whose eye is
filled and whose heart is occupied with Christ, could
ever yoke himself with a worldly partner, for any
object whatsoever. Wherefore, my beloved Christian
reader, let me once more entreat you, ere you take
such a tremendous step&mdash;a step fraught with such
awful consequences&mdash;so pregnant with danger to
your best interests, as well as to the testimony of
Christ, with which you are honored&mdash;to take the
whole matter, with an honest heart, into the sanctuary
of God, and weigh it in His sacred balance.
Ask Him what He thinks of it, and hearken, with a
subject will and a well-adjusted conscience, to His
reply. It is plain and powerful&mdash;yea, as plain and
as powerful as though it fell from the open heavens&mdash;"<i>Be
not unequally yoked together with unbelievers</i>."</p>

<p>But if, unhappily, my reader is already in the
yoke, I would say to him, disentangle yourself as
speedily as you can. I am much mistaken if you
have not already found the yoke a burdensome one.
To you it were superfluous to detail the sad consequences
of being in such a position; you doubtless
know them all. It is needless to print them on
paper, or paint them on canvas, to one who has
entered into all their reality. My beloved brother
in Christ, lose not a moment in seeking to throw off
the yoke. This must be done before the Lord, on
His principles, and by His grace. It is easier to
get into a wrong position than to get out of it. A
partnership of ten or twenty years' standing cannot
be dissolved in a moment. It must be done calmly,
humbly, and prayerfully, as in the sight of the Lord,
and with entire reference to His glory. I may dishonor
the Lord as much in my way of getting out
of a wrong position as by getting into it at the first.
Hence, if I find myself in partnership with an unbeliever,
and my conscience tells me I am wrong,
let me honestly and frankly state to my partner that
I can no longer go on with him; and having done
that, my place is to use every exertion to wind up
the affairs of the firm in an upright, a straightforward,
and businesslike manner, so as to give no
possible occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully,
and that my good may not be evil spoken of.
We must avoid rashness, headiness, and high-mindedness,
when apparently acting for the Lord,
and in defense of His holy principles. If a man
gets entangled in a net, or involved in a labyrinth,
it is not by bold and violent plunging he will extricate
himself. No; he must humble himself, confess
his sins before the Lord, and then retrace his steps,
in patient dependence upon that grace which can
not only pardon him for being in a wrong position,
but lead him forth into a right one.</p>

<p>Moreover, as in the case of the marriage-yoke,
the matter is very much modified by the fact of the
partnership having been entered into previous to
conversion. Not that this would, in the slightest
degree, justify a continuance in it. By no means;
but it does away with much of the sorrow of heart
and defilement of conscience connected with such a
position, and will also very materially affect the
mode of escape therefrom. Besides, the Lord is
glorified by, and He assuredly accepts, the moral
bent of the heart and conscience in the right direction.
If I judge myself for being wrong, and that
the moral bent of my heart and conscience is to get
right, God will accept of that, and surely set me
right. But if He sets me right, He will not suffer
me to do violence to one truth while seeking to act
in obedience to another. The same Word that says
"Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers"
says also "Render therefore to all their dues"&mdash;"owe
no man any thing"&mdash;"provide things honest
in the sight of all"&mdash;"walk honestly toward them
that are without." If I have wronged God by getting
into partnership with an unbeliever, I must not
wrong any man in my way of getting out of it.
Profound subjection to the Word of God, by the
power of the Holy Ghost, will set all to rights, will
lead us into straight paths, and enable us to avoid
all dangerous extremes.</p>


<p>III. In glancing for a moment at the religious
phase of the unequal yoke, I would assure my reader
that it is by no means my desire to hurt the feelings
of any one by canvassing the claims of the various
denominations around me. Such is not my purpose.
The subject of this paper is one of quite sufficient
importance to prevent its being encumbered by the
introduction of other matters. Moreover, it is too
definite to warrant any such introduction. "The
unequal yoke" is our theme, and to it we must confine
our attention.</p>

<p>In looking through Scripture we find almost numberless
passages setting forth the intense spirit of
separation which ought ever to characterize the
people of God. Whether we direct our attention to
the Old Testament, in which we have God's relationship
and dealings with His earthly people, Israel, or
to the New Testament, in which we have His relationship
and dealings with His heavenly people, the
Church, we find the same truth prominently set
forth, namely, the entire separation of those who
belong to God. Israel's position is thus stated in
Balaam's parable, "Lo, the people shall dwell alone,
and shall not be reckoned amongst the nations."
Their place was outside the range of all the nations
of the earth, and they were responsible to maintain
that separation. Throughout the entire Pentateuch
they were instructed, warned, and admonished as
to this; and throughout the psalms and the prophets
we have a record of their failure in the maintenance
of this separation, which failure, as we know, has
brought down upon them the heavy judgments of
the hand of God. It would swell this little paper
into a volume were I to attempt a quotation of all
the passages in which this point is put forward. I
take it for granted that my reader is sufficiently acquainted
with his Bible, to render such quotations
unnecessary. Should he not be so, however, a
reference, in his concordance, to the words, "separate,"
"separated," and "separation" will suffice
to lay before him at a glance the body of Scripture-evidence
on the subject. The passage just quoted
from the book of Numbers is the expression of
God's thoughts about His people Israel: "The people
shall dwell <small>ALONE</small>."</p>

<p>The same is true, only upon a much higher ground,
in reference to God's heavenly people, the Church&mdash;the
body of Christ&mdash;composed of all true believers.
They too are a separated people.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to examine the ground of
this separation. There is a great difference between
being separate on the ground of what we are and of
what <i>God</i> is. The former makes a man a <i>Pharisee</i>;
the latter makes him a <i>saint</i>. If I say to a poor
fellow-sinner, "Stand by thyself, I am holier than
thou," I am a detestable Pharisee and a hypocrite;
but if God, in His infinite condescension and perfect
grace, says to me, I have brought you into relationship
with Myself in the person of My Son Jesus
Christ, therefore be separate and holy from all evil;
come out from among them and be separate; I am
bound to obey, and my obedience is the practical
manifestation of my character as a saint&mdash;a character
which I have, not because of any thing in myself,
but simply because God has brought me near
unto Himself through the precious blood of Christ.</p>

<p>It is well to be clear as to this. Pharisaism and
divine sanctification are two very different things;
and yet they are often confounded. Those who
contend for the maintenance of that place of separation
which belongs to the people of God, are constantly
accused of setting themselves up above their
fellow-men, and of laying claim to a higher degree
of personal sanctity than is ordinarily possessed.
This accusation arises from not attending to the distinction
just referred to. When God calls upon men
to be separate, it is on the ground of what He has
done for them upon the cross, and where He has set
them, in eternal association with Himself, in the person
of Christ. But if I separate myself on the ground
of what I am in myself, it is the most senseless
and vapid assumption, which will sooner or later be
made manifest. God commands His people to be
holy on the ground of what He is: "Be ye holy, for
I am holy." This is evidently a very different thing
from "Stand by thyself: I am holier than thou."
If God brings people into association with Himself,
He has a right to prescribe what their moral character
ought to be, and they are responsible to answer
thereto. Thus we see that the most profound humility
lies at the bottom of a saint's separation.
There is nothing so calculated to put one in the dust
as the understanding of the real nature of divine
holiness. It is an utterly false humility which springs
from looking at ourselves&mdash;yea, it is, in reality, based
upon pride, which has never yet seen to the bottom
of its own perfect worthlessness. Some imagine
that they can reach the truest and deepest humility
by looking at self, whereas it can only be reached
by looking at Christ.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The more Thy glories strike mine eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The humbler I shall be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is a just sentiment, founded upon divine principle.
The soul that loses itself in the blaze of
Christ's moral glory is truly humble, and none other.
No doubt we have a right to be humble when we
think of what poor creatures we are, but it only
needs a moment's just reflection to see the fallacy
of seeking to produce any practical result by looking
at self. It is only when we find ourselves in the
presence of infinite excellency that we are really
humble.</p>

<p>Hence, therefore, a child of God should refuse to
be yoked with an unbeliever, whether for a domestic,
a commercial, or a religious object, simply because
God tells him to be separate, and not because of his
own personal holiness. The carrying out of this
principle in matters of religion will necessarily
involve much trial and sorrow; it will be termed
intolerance, bigotry, narrow-mindedness, exclusiveness,
and such like; but we cannot help all this.
Provided we keep ourselves separate upon a right
principle and in a right spirit, we may safely leave
all results with God. No doubt the remnant in the
days of Ezra must have appeared excessively intolerant
in refusing the co-operation of the surrounding
people in building the house of God, but they
acted upon divine principle in the refusal. "Now
when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard
that the children of the captivity builded the temple
unto the Lord God of Israel, then they came to
Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and
said unto them, 'Let us build with you; for we seek
your God as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto Him,
since the days of Esar-haddon, king of Assur,
which brought us up hither.'" This might seem a
very attractive proposal&mdash;a proposal evidencing a
very decided leaning toward the God of Israel; yet
the remnant refused, because the people, notwithstanding
their fair profession, were, at heart, uncircumcised
and hostile. "But Zerubbabel and Jeshua
and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel
said unto them, 'Ye have nothing to do <i>with us</i> to
build a house unto <i>our</i> God; but <i>we ourselves together</i>
will build unto the Lord God of Israel."
(Ezra iv. 1-3.) They would not yoke themselves
with the uncircumcised&mdash;they would not "plow with
an ox and ass"&mdash;they would not "sow their field
with mingled seed"&mdash;they kept themselves separate,
even though by so doing they exposed themselves to
the charge of being a bigoted, narrow-minded,
illiberal, uncharitable set of people.</p>

<p>So also in Nehemiah we read, "And the seed of
Israel <i>separated themselves</i> from all strangers, and
stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of
their fathers." (Chap. ix. 2.) This was not sectarianism,
but positive obedience. Their separation
was essential to their existence as a people. They
could not have enjoyed the divine presence on any
other ground. Thus it must ever be with God's
people on the earth. They must be separate, or else
they are not only useless, but mischievous. God
cannot own or accompany them if they yoke themselves
with unbelievers, upon any ground or for any
object whatsoever. The grand difficulty is to combine
a spirit of intense separation with a spirit of
grace, gentleness, and forbearance; or, as another
has said, "to maintain <i>a narrow circle</i> with <i>a wide
heart</i>." This is really a difficulty. As the strict
and uncompromising maintenance of <i>truth</i> tends to
narrow the circle around us, we shall need the expansive
power of <i>grace</i> to keep the heart wide, and
the affections warm. If we contend for <i>truth</i> otherwise
than in <i>grace</i>, we shall only yield a one-sided
and most unattractive testimony. And on the other
hand, if we try to exhibit grace at the expense of
truth, it will prove, in the end, to be only the manifestation
of a popular liberality at God's expense&mdash;a
most worthless thing.</p>

<p>Then, as to the object for which real Christians
usually yoke themselves with those who, even on
their own confession, and in the judgment of charity
itself, are not Christians at all, it will be found in
the end that no really divine and heavenly object
can be gained by an infringement of God's truth.
<i>Per fas aut nefas</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> can never be a divine motto. The
means are not sanctified by the end; but both means
and end must be according to the principles of God's
holy Word, else all must eventuate in confusion and
dishonor. It might have appeared to Jehoshaphat
a very worthy object to recover Ramoth Gilead out
of the hand of the enemy; and moreover, he might
have appeared a very liberal, gracious, popular, large-hearted
man, when, in reply to Ahab's proposal, he
said, "I am as thou art, and my people as thy
people; and <i>we will be with thee</i> in the war." It is
easy to be liberal and large-hearted at the expense
of divine principle; but how did it end? Ahab was
killed, and Jehoshaphat narrowly escaped with his
life, having made total shipwreck of his testimony.</p>

<p>Thus we see that Jehoshaphat did not even gain
the object for which he unequally yoked himself with
an unbeliever: and even had he gained it, it would
have been no justification of his course.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Nothing
can ever warrant a believer's yoking himself with an
unbeliever; and therefore however fair, attractive,
and plausible the Ramoth expedition might seem in
the eye of man, it was, in the judgment of God,
"helping the ungodly, and loving them that hate the
Lord." (2 Chron. xix. 2.) The truth of God strips
men and things of the false colors with which the
spirit of expediency would deck them, and presents
them in their proper light; and it is an unspeakable
mercy to have the clear judgment of God about all
that is going on around us: it imparts calmness to
the spirit, and stability to the course and character,
and saves one from that unhappy fluctuation of
thought, feeling, and principle which so entirely
unfits him for the place of a steady and consistent
witness for Christ. We shall surely err if we attempt
to form our judgment by the thoughts and
opinions of men; for they will always judge according
to the outward appearances, and not according
to the intrinsic character and principle of things.
Provided men can gain what they conceive to be a
right object, they care not about the mode of gaining
it. But the true servant of Christ knows that
he must do his Master's work upon his Master's
principles and in his Master's spirit. It will not
satisfy such an one to reach the most praiseworthy
end unless he can reach it by a divinely appointed
road. The means and the end must both be divine.
I admit it, for example, to be a most desirable end
to circulate the Scriptures&mdash;God's own pure, eternal
Word; but if <i>I could not</i> circulate them save by
yoking myself with an unbeliever, I should refrain,
inasmuch as I am not to do evil that good may
come.</p>

<p>But, blessed be God, His servant can circulate
His precious book without violating the precepts
contained in that book. He can, upon his own individual
responsibility, or in fellowship with those
who are really on the Lord's side, scatter the precious
seed every where, without leaguing himself
with those whose whole course and conduct prove
them to be of the world. The same may be said in
reference to every object of a religious nature. It
can and should be gained on God's principles, and
only thus. It may be argued, in reply, that we are
told not to judge&mdash;that we cannot read the heart&mdash;and
that we are bound to hope that all who would
engage in such good works as the translation of the
Bible, the distribution of tracts, and the aiding of
missionary labors, must be Christians; and that
therefore it cannot be wrong to link ourselves with
them. To all this I reply that there is hardly a
passage in the New Testament so misunderstood
and misapplied as Matthew vii. 1&mdash;"Judge not, that
ye be not judged." In the very same chapter we
read, "Beware of the false prophets: ... by
their fruits ye shall know them." Now, how are
we to "beware" if we do not exercise judgment?
Again, in 1 Corinthians v. we read, "For what have
I to do to judge them also that are without? do not
ye judge them that are within? But them that are
without God judgeth. Therefore put away from
among yourselves that wicked person." Here we
are distinctly taught that those "within" come
within the immediate range of the Church's judgment;
and yet according to the common interpretation
of Matthew vii. 1 we ought not to judge anybody;
that interpretation, therefore, must needs be
unsound. If people take, even in profession, the
ground of being "within," we are commanded to
judge them. "Do not ye judge them that are within?"
As to those "without" we have naught to
do with them, save to present the pure and perfect,
the rich, illimitable, and unfathomable grace which
shines, with unclouded effulgence, in the death and
resurrection of the Son of God.</p>

<p>All this is plain enough. The people of God are
told to exercise judgment as to all who profess to
be "within;" they are told to "beware of false
prophets;" they are commanded to "try the spirits:"
and how can they do all this if they are not to judge
at all? What, then, does our Lord mean, when He
says, "Judge not"? I believe He means just what
St. Paul, by the Holy Ghost, says, when he commands
us to "judge nothing before the time, until the
Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden
things of darkness, and will make manifest the
counsels of the heart: and then shall every man
have praise of God." (1 Cor. iv. 5.) We have
nothing to do with judging motives, but we have to
judge conduct and principles; that is to say, the
conduct and principles of all who profess to be
"within." And, in point of fact, the very persons
who say, "We must not judge," do themselves
constantly exercise judgment. There is no true
Christian in whom the moral instincts of the divine
nature do not virtually pronounce judgment as to
character, conduct, and doctrine; and these are the
very points which are placed within the believer's
range of judgment.</p>

<p>All, therefore, that I would press upon the Christian
reader is, that he would exercise judgment as
to those with whom he yokes himself in matters of
religion. If he is at this moment working in yoke
or in harness with an unbeliever, he is positively violating
the command of the Holy Ghost. He may be
ignorantly doing so up to this: and if so, the Lord's
grace is ready to pardon and restore: but if he persist
in disobedience after having been warned, he
cannot possibly expect God's blessing and presence
with him, no matter how valuable or important the
object which he may seek to attain. "To obey is
better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat
of rams."</p>

<p>IV. We have only now to consider the philanthropic
phase of the unequal yoke. Many will say,
I quite admit that we ought not to mingle ourselves
with positive unbelievers in the worship or service
of God, but then we can freely unite with such for
the furtherance of objects of philanthropy&mdash;such,
for instance, as feeding the hungry, clothing the
naked, reclaiming the vicious, in providing asylums
for the blind and lunatic, hospitals and infirmaries
for the sick and infirm, places of refuge for the
homeless and houseless, the fatherless and the
widow; and in short, for the furtherance of every
thing that tends to promote the amelioration of our
fellow-creatures, physically, morally, and intellectually.</p>

<p>This, at first sight, seems fair enough; for I may
be asked if I would not help a man by the roadside
to get his cart out of the ditch. I reply, Certainly;
but if I were asked to become a member of a mixed
society for the purpose of getting carts out of ditches,
I should refuse&mdash;not because of my superior sanctity,
but because God's Word says, "Be not unequally
yoked together with unbelievers." This
would be my answer, no matter what were the object
proposed by a mixed society. The servant of Christ
is commanded "to be ready to every good work"&mdash;"to
do good unto all"&mdash;"to visit the fatherless and
the widows in their affliction;" but then it is as the
servant of Christ, and not as the member of a society
or a committee in which there may be infidels and
atheists, and all sorts of wicked and godless men.
Moreover, we must remember that all God's philanthropy
is connected with the cross of the Lord Jesus
Christ. That is the channel through which God will
bless&mdash;that the mighty lever by which He will elevate
man, physically, morally, and intellectually. "After
that the kindness and philanthropy [&#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#953;&#945;]
of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by
works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing
of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ
our Saviour." (Titus iii. 4-6.) This is God's philanthropy;
this is His mode of ameliorating man's
condition. With all who understand its worth the
Christian can readily yoke himself, but with none
other.</p>

<p>The men of the world know naught of this, care
not for it. They may seek reformation, but it is
reformation without Christ; they may promote amelioration,
but it is amelioration without the cross.
They wish to advance, but Jesus is neither the starting-post
nor the goal of their course. How, then,
can the Christian yoke himself with them? They
want to work without Christ, the very One to whom
he owes every thing. Can he be satisfied to work
with them? can he have an object in common with
them? If men come to me and say, "We want your
co-operation in feeding the hungry, in clothing the
naked, in founding hospitals and lunatic asylums,
in feeding and educating orphans, in improving the
physical condition of our fellow-mortals; but you
must remember that a leading rule of the society,
the board, or the committee formed for such objects
is, that the name of Christ is not to be introduced,
as it would only lead to controversy. Our objects
being not at all religious, but undividedly philanthropic,
the subject of religion must be studiously
excluded from all our public meetings. We are met
as <i>men</i>, for a benevolent purpose, and therefore infidels,
atheists, Socinians, Arians, Romanists, and
all sorts, can happily yoke themselves to move onward
the glorious machine of philanthropy." What
should be my answer to such an application? The
fact is, words would fail one who really loved
the Lord Jesus, in attempting to reply to an appeal
so monstrous. What! benefit mortals by the exclusion
of Christ? God forbid! If I cannot gain the
objects of pure philanthropy without setting aside
that blessed One who lived and died, and lives eternally
for me, then away with your philanthropy, for
it assuredly is not God's, but Satan's. If it were
God's, the word is, "He shed it on us abundantly
through Jesus Christ," the very One whom your
rule leaves entirely out. Hence your rule must be
the direct dictation of Satan, the enemy of Christ.
Satan would always like to leave out the Son of
God; and when he can get men to do the same, he
will allow them to be benevolent, charitable, and
philanthropic.</p>

<p>But, in good truth, such benevolence and philanthropy
ought to be termed malevolence and misanthropy,
for how can you more effectually exhibit
ill-will and hatred toward men than by leaving out
THE ONLY ONE who can really bless them, for time or
for eternity? But what must be the moral condition
of a heart, in reference to Christ, who could take
his seat at a board, or on a platform, on the condition
that that name must not be introduced? It
must be cold indeed; yea, it proves that the plans
and operations of unconverted men are of sufficient
importance, in his judgment, to lead him to throw
his Master overboard, for the purpose of carrying
them out. Let us not mistake matters. This is the
true aspect in which to view the world's philanthropy.
The men of this world can "sell ointment for three
hundred pence, and give to the poor;" while they
pronounce it <i>waste</i> to pour that ointment on the
head of Christ! Will the Christian consent to this?
Will he yoke himself with such? Will he seek to
improve the world without Christ? Will he join with
men to deck and garnish a scene which is stained
with his Master's blood? Peter could say, "Silver
and gold have I none; but such as I have give I
thee: in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise
up and walk." Peter would heal a cripple by the
power of the name of Jesus, but what would he have
said if asked to join a committee or society to alleviate
cripples, on the condition of leaving that name
out altogether? It requires no great stretch of imagination
to conceive his answer. His whole soul
would recoil from such a thought. He only healed
the cripple for the purpose of exalting the name of
Jesus, and setting forth its worth, its excellency,
and its glory, in the view of men: but the very reverse
is the object of the world's philanthropy; inasmuch
as it sets aside His blessed name entirely,
and banishes Him from its boards, its committees,
and its platforms.</p>

<p>May we not therefore well say, Shame on the
Christian who is found in a place from which his
Master is shut out? Oh, let him go forth, and, in
the energy of love to Jesus, and by the power of
that name, do all the good he can; but let him not
yoke himself with unbelievers, to counteract the
effects of sin by excluding the cross of Christ.
God's grand object is to exalt His Son&mdash;"that all
should honor the Son even as they honor the
Father." This should be the Christian's object
likewise; to this end he should "do good unto all;"
but if he join a society or a committee in order to
do good, it is not "in the name of Jesus" he acts,
but in the name of the society or committee, without
the name of Jesus. This ought to be enough for
every true and loyal heart. God has no other way
of blessing men but through Christ, and no other
object in blessing them but to exalt Christ. As with
Pharaoh of old, when the hungry Egyptians flocked
to his presence, his word was, "Go to Joseph;" so
God's word to all is, "Come to Jesus." Yes, for
soul and body, time and eternity, we must go to
Jesus; but the men of the world know Him not, and
want Him not; what, therefore, has the Christian to
do with such? How can he act in yoke with them?
He can only do so on the ground of practically denying
his Saviour's name. Many do not see this; but
that does not alter the case for those who do. We
ought to act honestly, as in the light; and even
though the feelings and affections of the new nature
were not sufficiently strong in us to lead us to shrink
from ranking ourselves with the enemies of Christ,
the conscience ought, at least, to bow to the commanding
authority of that word, "<span class="smcap">Be not unequally
yoked together with unbelievers</span>."</p>

<p>May the Holy Ghost clothe His own Word with
heavenly power, and make its edge sharp to pierce
the conscience, that so the saints of God may be
delivered from every thing that hinders their "running
the race that is set before them." Time is
short. The Lord Himself will soon be here. Then
many an unequal yoke will be broken in a moment;
many a sheep and goat shall then be eternally severed.
May we be enabled to purge ourselves from
every unclean association and every unhallowed influence,
so that when Jesus returns, we may not be
ashamed, but meet Him with a joyful heart and an
approving conscience.</p>

<h2>GIDEON AND HIS COMPANIONS</h2>

<h3>Judges vi.-viii.</h3>


<h4>PART I.</h4>

<p>In studying the history of the nation of Israel, we
notice two distinct eras, namely, the era of
<i>unity</i>, and the era of <i>individuality</i>&mdash;the period in
which the twelve tribes acted as one man, and the
period in the which one man was called to act for
the twelve tribes. We may take the Book of Joshua
as illustrating the former; and the Book of Judges
as a sample of the latter. The most cursory reader
cannot fail to discern the difference between these
two books. The one is characterized by external
power and glory; the other, by weakness and failure.
Power is stamped on the former, ruin on the
latter. In that, Jehovah gives the land to Israel;
in this, Israel fails to take the land from Jehovah.</p>

<p>Now, all this is expressed in the two words which
may be regarded as the motto of the two books,
namely, "Gilgal" and "Bochim." In the book
of Joshua we find the congregation always starting
from Gilgal to prosecute the war, and returning
thither to celebrate their victory. Gilgal was their
centre, because there they were circumcised; and
there the reproach of Egypt was rolled away. See
Josh. v. 9, 10.</p>

<p>But no sooner have we opened the book of Judges
than the eye rests upon the sad record, "The angel
of the Lord came up <i>from Gilgal to Bochim</i>, and
said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have
brought you unto the land which I sware unto your
fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant
with you. And ye shall make no league with
the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down
their altars, but ye have not obeyed my voice; why
have ye done this? Wherefore I also said, I will
not drive them out from before you; but they shall
be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be
a snare unto you. And it came to pass, when the
angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the
children of Israel, that the people lifted up their
voice, and wept. And they called the name of that
place Bochim, that is, weepers; and they sacrificed
there unto the Lord" (Judges ii. 1-5).</p>

<p>Here, then, we have, very remarkably, the contrast
between the two books of Joshua and Judges&mdash;the
book of unity and the book of individuality&mdash;the
book of external power and glory, and the book
of internal weakness, failure, and ruin. Alas! alas!
the glory speedily departed. Israel's national greatness
soon faded away. "The people served the
Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the
elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the
great works of the Lord, that he did for Israel.
And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the
Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old....
And also all that generation were gathered
unto their fathers: and there arose another generation
after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet
the works which He had done for Israel. And the
children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord,
and served Baalim.... And they forsook the Lord,
and served Baal and Ashtaroth. And the anger of
the Lord was hot against Israel, and He delivered
them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them,
and He sold them into the hands of their enemies
round about, so that they could not any longer stand
before their enemies. Whithersoever they went out,
the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as
the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn unto
them; and they were greatly distressed."</p>

<p>This, truly, is a gloomy and humiliating record.
Joshua's sword was sheathed. Those bright days
in the which he had led Israel's compact host to
splendid victories over the kings of Canaan, were
passed and gone. The moral influence of Joshua
and of the elders that survived him had passed
away, and the whole nation had rushed, with terrible
avidity, into the gross moral evils and abominable
idolatries of those nations whom they ought to have
driven out from before them. In a word, the ruin
was complete, so far as Israel was concerned. Like
Adam, in the garden; and Noah, in the restored
earth; so Israel, in the land of Canaan, utterly
failed. Adam ate the forbidden fruit; Noah got
drunk; and Israel bowed before the altars of Baal.</p>

<p>Thus much as to man. But, thank God, there is
another side of the picture. There is what we may
call a bright and beauteous "<i>Nevertheless</i>;" for God
will be God, no matter what man may prove himself
to be. This is an unspeakable relief and consolation
to the heart. God abideth faithful. Here is
faith's stronghold, come what may. God is always
to be counted upon, spite of all man's failure and
shortcoming. His goodness and faithfulness form
the resource and the refuge of the soul amid the
darkest scenes of human history.</p>

<p>This soul-sustaining truth shines out with remarkable
lustre in the very passage from which we have
just given such a depressing quotation. "Nevertheless,
the Lord raised up judges, which delivered
them out of the hand of those that spoiled them."
But mark the following words, so illustrative of the
individuality of the book of Judges: "And when
the Lord raised them up judges, then <i>the Lord was
with the judge</i>, and delivered them out of the hand
of their enemies <i>all the days of the judge</i>: for it repented
the Lord because of their groanings by reason
of them that oppressed them and vexed them"
(Judges ii. 16, 18).</p>

<p>In these last quoted words, we have the great
root principle of the book of Judges&mdash;the divine
secret of the ministry of the Baraks, the Gideons,
the Jephthahs, and the Samsons, the record of whose
ministry occupies so large a portion of this most interesting
section of inspiration. Israel had failed&mdash;sadly,
shamefully, inexcusably failed. They had
forfeited all claims to the protection of Jehovah's
shield. They were justly given over into the ruthless
hands of the kings of Canaan. As to all this
there could be no possible question. "Nevertheless"
Jehovah's heart could feel for His poor, oppressed,
and groaning Israel. True, they had
proved themselves naughty and unworthy, yet His
ear was ever ready to catch their very earliest groan;
yea, we are even told, in chapter x., that "His soul
was grieved for the misery of Israel."</p>

<p>What touching words! What tenderness! What
deep compassion! How such a statement lets us
into the profound depths of the heart of God! The
misery of His people moved the loving heart of
Jehovah. The very faintest and earliest symptoms
of brokenness and contrition, on the part of Israel,
met with a ready and gracious response, on the part
of Israel's God. It mattered not how far they had
wandered, how deeply they had sunk, or how grievously
they had sinned; God was ever ready to
welcome the feeblest breathings of a broken heart.
The springs of divine mercy and compassion are
absolutely inexhaustible. The ocean of His love is
boundless and unfathomable; and hence, the very
moment His people take the place of confession,
He enters the place of forgiveness. He delights to
pardon, according to the largeness of His heart, and
according to the glory of His own Name. He finds
His peculiar joy in blotting out transgressions, in
healing, restoring, and blessing, in a manner worthy
of Himself. This glorious truth shines in the history
of Israel; it shines in the history of the Church;
and it shines in the history of every individual believer.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But we turn to our immediate subject, namely,
"Gideon and his companions," as presented in that
portion of the book of Judges given at the head of
this paper. May the eternal Spirit unfold and apply
its precious contents to our souls!</p>

<p>Chapter vi. opens with a very sad and depressing
record&mdash;a record only too characteristic of Israel's
entire history: "And the children of Israel did evil
in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord delivered
them into the hand of Midian seven years. And
the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and
because of the Midianites the children of Israel
made them the dens which are in the mountains,
and caves, and strongholds." What a humiliating
picture! What a contrast to the conquering host
that had crossed the Jordan and walked across the
ruins of Jericho! How sad, how humbling, to think
of Israel crouching and hiding in the dens and
caves of the mountains, through the terror of the
uncircumcised Midianites!</p>

<p>It is well for us to consider this picture, and receive
its salutary lesson. Israel's power and glory
consisted simply in having the presence of God with
them. Without that, they were as water spilt upon
the ground, or the autumn leaf before the blast.
But the divine presence could not be enjoyed in
connection with allowed evil; and therefore, when
Israel forgot their Lord, and wandered away from
Him into the forbidden paths of idolatry, He had
to recall them to their senses by stretching out His
governmental rod, and causing them to feel the
crushing power of one or another of the nations
around.</p>

<p>Now all this has a voice and a lesson for us. So
long as God's people walk with Him in holy obedience,
they have nothing to fear. They are perfectly
safe from the snares and assaults of all their spiritual
foes. Nought can, by any means, harm them
while they abide in the shelter of God's own presence.
But, clearly, that presence demands and secures
holiness. Unjudged evil cannot dwell there.
To live in sin and talk of security&mdash;to attempt to
connect the presence of God with sanctioned evil&mdash;is
wickedness of the deepest dye. No, it must not
be! "God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of
the saints; and to be had in reverence of all them
that are round about Him." "Thy testimonies are
very sure; holiness becometh Thy house, O Lord,
forever." If God's people forget these wholesome
truths, He knows how to recall them to their remembrance
by the rod of discipline; and, blessed
forever be His name, He loves them too well to
spare that rod, however reluctant He may be to use
it. "Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and
scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. If ye endure
chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons:
for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are
partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh, which
corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we
not much rather be in subjection unto the Father
of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days
chastened us after their own pleasure; but He for
our profit, that we might be partakers of His holiness.
Now no chastening for the present seemeth
to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheless afterward
it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
them which are exercised thereby. <i>Wherefore lift</i>
<i>up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees</i>"
(Hebrews xii. 6-12).</p>

<p>These are encouraging words for the people of
God, at all times. The discipline may be&mdash;no doubt
is&mdash;painful; but when we know a Father's hand is
in it, and when we realize what His object is, we
can pass through the trial with exercised hearts, and
thus reap the peaceable fruits of righteousness. On
the other hand, if we meet the discipline with an
impatient spirit, a rebellious will, an unsubdued
mind, we only render it necessary for the pressure
to be continued and augmented, for our loving
Father will never let us alone. He will have us in
holy subjection to Himself, cost what it may. He
graciously takes our part against ourselves, subdues
the proud risings of our will, and crushes all that in
us which hinders our growth in holiness, grace, and
divine knowledge.</p>

<p>Oh! what infinite grace shines in the fact that
our God occupies Himself with our very failure and
follies, our waywardness and wilfulness, our sins
and shortcomings, in order to deliver us from them!
He knows all about us. He understands and takes
into account all our surroundings and all our inward
tendencies, and He deals with us in infinite wisdom
and perfect patience, keeping ever before Him that
one gracious object, to make us partakers of His
holiness, and&mdash;wondrous thought!&mdash;to bring out in
us the expression of His own nature and character.
Surely, then, in the presence of such abounding
grace and mercy, we may well "lift up the hands
that hang down, and the feeble knees."</p>


<h4>PART II.</h4>

<p>There is one truth which shines out with uncommon
lustre in the book of Judges, and that is,
that God is ever to be counted upon, even amid the
darkest scenes of human history; and, moreover,
faith can always count upon God; God never fails
a trusting heart&mdash;no, never. He never has failed,
never will, never can fail the individual soul that
confides in Him, that takes hold of His precious
word, in the artless simplicity of a faith that trusts
Him in the face of man's deepest failure and shortcoming.</p>

<p>This is most consolatory and encouraging, at all
times, and under all circumstances. True it is&mdash;alas!
how true! man fails in everthing. Trace him
where you will; mark him in whatever sphere of
action or responsibility he occupies, and it is the
same sad tale, over and over again, of unfaithfulness,
failure, and ruin. Let man be set up in business,
as often as he may, with the largest capital and the
fairest prospects, and he is sure to become a bankrupt.
It has ever been so, from the days of Eden
down to the present moment. We may assert, without
fear of contradiction, that there has not been
one solitary exception to the dismal rule, in the history
of Adam's fallen race. We must never forget
this. True faith never forgets it. It would be the
blindest folly to attempt to ignore the fact that <i>ruin</i>
is stamped, in characters deep and broad, upon the
entire of man's story, from first to last.</p>

<p>But, in the face of all this, God abideth faithful.
He cannot deny Himself. Here is the resource and
the resting-place of faith. It recognizes and owns
the ruin; but it counts on God. Faith is not blind
to human failure; but it fixes its gaze on divine
faithfulness. It confesses the ruin of man; but it
counts on the resources of God.</p>

<p>Now, all this comes strikingly out in the interesting
and instructive story of Gideon. He, truly, was
made to realize, in his own person and experience,
the fact of Israel's fallen condition. The contrast
between Joshua and Gideon is as striking as can be,
so far as regards the question of their condition and
circumstances. Joshua could place his foot on the
necks of the kings of Canaan. Gideon had to thrash
his wheat in a corner to hide it from the Midianites.
The day of Joshua was marked by splendid victories;
the day of Gideon was a day of small things.
But the day of small things for man is the day of
great things for God. So Gideon found it. True,
it was not permitted him to witness the sun and
moon arrested in their course, or the cities of the
uncircumcised levelled with the ground. His was
a day of barley cakes and broken pitchers, not of
astounding miracles and brilliant achievements.
But God was with him; and this was enough.
"There came an angel of the Lord, and sat under
an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto
Joash the Abiezrite; and his son Gideon threshed
wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
him, and said unto him, The Lord is with thee, <i>thou
mighty man of valor</i>" (Judges vi. 11, 12).</p>

<p>What words were these to fall upon the ear of
Gideon, cowering in the winepress, through fear of
the enemy! They were words from heaven to lift
his soul above the trials, and sorrows, and humiliations
of earth&mdash;words of divine power and virtue to
infuse vigor into his depressed and sorrowing heart.
"Thou mighty man of valor!" How hard was it
for Gideon to take such wondrous accents in! How
difficult to apply them to himself! Where was the
might or where was the valor? Most surely not in
himself or in his surroundings. Where then? In
the living God; precisely where Joshua found his
might and his valor. Indeed there is a striking
similarity in the terms in which both these eminent
servants of God were addressed. The similarity of
the terms is quite as marked as is the contrast in
their circumstances. Here are the terms to Joshua:
"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of
a good courage: be not thou afraid, neither be thou
dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee
whithersoever thou goest." And the terms to
Gideon are: "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty
man of valor."</p>

<p>Precious words! Soul-stirring, heart-strengthening
accents! And yet Gideon was slow to make
them his own&mdash;slow to grasp them, in the lovely
appropriating power of faith, which so delights the
heart of God, and glorifies His name. How often
is it thus with us! How constantly we fail to rise
to the height of God's gracious thoughts and purposes
towards us! We are prone to <i>reason</i> about
ourselves and our surroundings, instead of believing
God, and resting, in sweet tranquillity, in His perfect
love and faithfulness.</p>

<p>Thus it was with that dear man of God on whose
history we are dwelling. The divine statement was
clear, full, absolute, and unconditional: "The Lord
<i>is</i> with thee." There was no ground, in these words,
for any question or doubt, whatsoever; and yet
mark Gideon's reply: "And Gideon said unto Him,
O my Lord, <i>if</i> the Lord be with us, why then is all
this befallen us? And where be all His miracles
which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the
Lord bring us up from Egypt? but now the Lord
hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands
of the Midianites" (verse 13).</p>

<p>Here, as is evident, Gideon reasons from his surroundings.
Hence the "<i>if</i>"&mdash;that little monosyllable
of unbelief. It is a familiar remark amongst us,
"If you want to be miserable, look within; if you
want to be distracted, look around; if you want to
be peaceful and happy, look up&mdash;'look off unto
Jesus.'" This is most true. So surely as we become
occupied with self, or with men and things,
the circumstances which surround us, we must be
unhinged and unhappy. Our only strength, our
only comfort, our only light, is to keep the eye of
faith fixed on Jesus, and the heart firmly centred in
Him. Most certainly Gideon's surroundings were
of the gloomiest character. His "sensible horizon"
was overhung with dark and heavy clouds. But
there was one bright and blessed ray which shone
in upon his depressed spirit&mdash;a ray emanating from
the very heart of God, and conveyed in that one
brief but comprehensive sentence, "The Lord is
with thee." There was no "if" in this&mdash;no doubt,
no reserve, no condition. It was distinct and unqualified,
and needed only one thing to make it a
spring of joy, strength, and victory in Gideon's soul,
and that was to mix it with faith. But then "if" is
not faith. True faith never answers God with ifs,
for the simplest of all reasons, that it looks only at
God, and there are no ifs with Him. Faith reasons
from God downwards; not from man upwards.
Faith has only one difficulty, and that difficulty is
embodied in the question, "How shall He <i>not?</i>"
It never says, "How shall He?" This is the language
of sheer unbelief.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked by some, was there not some
foundation for Gideon's "if" and "why?" Certainly
not in God or in His word, whatever there
had been in Israel and their actings. No doubt, if
Gideon had only cast his eye back over the pages
of his national history, he might have discovered
ample reason for the sad and humiliating condition
in which he found himself. Those blotted pages
would have furnished an abundant answer to his
question, "Why then is all this befallen us?" But
had Israel's actings dimmed the lustre of Jehovah's
mighty "miracles?" Not in the vision of faith,
most surely. God had done great and glorious
things for His people; and the record of those doings
lay ever under the eye of faith, in all its soul-sustaining
virtue. No doubt Israel had failed&mdash;shamefully
failed; and the record of that failure lay
also under the eye of faith, and furnished a solemn
answer to Gideon's inquiry, "Why is all this befallen
us?" Faith recognizes God's government as
well as His grace, and moreover it bows, in solemn
awe, before each stroke of His governmental rod.</p>

<p>It is well to keep all this in mind. We are apt
to forget it. God has, at times, to stretch forth his
hand and lift the rod of authority. He cannot own
what is contrary to His Name and His nature.
Now, Gideon needed to remember this. Israel had
sinned, and this was the reason why they were under
the rod, of which the power of the Midianites was
the expression in Gideon's day.</p>

<p>Gideon, we repeat, was called to enter practically
into the meaning of all this; and not only so, but
to taste the reality of identification with his people
in all their pressure and affliction. This latter, as
we know, was the portion and experience of every
true servant of God in Israel. All had to pass
through those deep exercises of soul consequent
upon their association with the people of God. It
mattered not whether it were a judge, a prophet, a
priest, or a king; all had to participate in the sorrows
and trials of the nation of Israel; nor could
any true heart&mdash;any genuine lover of God or His
people&mdash;desire exemption from such deep and holy
exercises. This was pre-eminently true of the only
perfect Servant that ever stood upon this earth. He,
though personally exempt from all the consequences
of Israel's sin and failure&mdash;though pure and spotless,
divinely holy in nature and in life&mdash;did nevertheless,
in perfect grace, voluntarily identify Himself
with the people in all their sorrow and humiliation.
"In all their affliction He was afflicted." Thus it was
with our blessed Lord Jesus Christ; and all who, in
any degree, partook of His Spirit, had, according to
their measure, to taste of the same cup, though none
could ever come up to Him in this or in aught else.</p>

<p>But when we come to compare closely the angel's
words to Gideon, with his reply, we notice a point
of deep interest, and one which illustrates the individual
character of the book of Judges. The angel
says, "The Lord is with <i>thee</i>." Gideon replies, "If
the Lord be with <i>us</i>." This is very interesting and
instructive; moreover it is in full keeping with a
passage already referred to, in chap, iii.: "And when
the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was
<i>with the judge</i>." It does not say, "with the people,"
but adds, with touching grace, "and <i>delivered them</i>
out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the
judge; for it repented the Lord because of their
groanings by reason of them that oppressed them
and vexed them" (ver. 18).</p>

<p>There is peculiar sweetness and beauty in this. If
Jehovah had to hide His face from His people, and
give them over, for the time, into the hand of the
uncircumcised, yet His loving heart was ever turned
towards them, and ever ready to mark and recognize
the faintest traces of a repentant spirit. "Who is a
God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and
passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His
heritage? He retaineth not His anger forever, because
He delighteth in mercy. He will turn again,
He will have compassion upon us; He will subdue
our iniquities; and Thou wilt cast all their
sins into the depths of the sea. Thou wilt perform
the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which
Thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of
old" (Micah. vii. 18-20).</p>


<h4>PART III.</h4>

<p>Nothing can be more encouraging to the heart
than the mode in which the Lord deals with the soul
of Gideon&mdash;the way in which He prepares him for
the course of action to which He was calling him.
Gideon, like ourselves, was full of "ifs" and "whys,"&mdash;those
little words so big with unbelief. The poor
human heart is ever slow to take in the magnificence
of divine grace; our feeble vision is dazzled
by the brilliancy of divine revelation. It is only
artless faith which can cause the soul to feel perfectly
at home in the presence of the richest unfoldings
of the goodness and loving-kindness of God.
Faith never says "if" or "why?" It believes what
God says, because He says it. It rests, in sweet
tranquility, upon every word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of God. Unbelief looks at circumstances
and reasons from them: faith looks at God, and
reasons from Him. Hence the vast difference in
their conclusions. Gideon, judging from his surroundings,
concluded that Jehovah had forsaken
His people. A simple faith would have led him to
the very opposite conclusion; it would have enabled
him to see and know and remember that Jehovah
would ever be true to His promise to Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, however He might, in His governmental
dealings, have to hide His face from their
rebellious and sinful offspring. Faith always counts
on God; and God, blessed be His name, ever
honors faith. He first produces it in us, and then
owns it.</p>

<p>But not only does God graciously honor faith;
He rebukes our fears. He rises above our unbelief,
and hushes all our silly reasonings. Thus, in His
dealings with His chosen servant Gideon, it would
seem as though He heard not the "if" or the "why?"
He goes on to unfold His own thoughts, to display
His own resources, and to fill the soul of His servant
with a confidence and a courage which were to
lift him above all the depressing influences with
which he was surrounded.</p>

<p>"And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go
in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel out of
the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?"
Here we have the true secret of strength: "The Lord
looked upon him." There was divine power in this
look, if Gideon could only have taken it in. But,
alas! he was still full of questions. "And he said
unto Him, O my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?
Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am
the least in my father's house."</p>

<p>Thus, unbelief turns the eye in upon self, or out
upon our surroundings. It leads us to compare our
visible resources with the work to which God is calling
us. Jehovah had said, "Go in this thy might."
What was the "might?" In what did it consist?
Was it great wealth, lofty position, or great physical
power? Nothing of the kind. "Jehovah looked
upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou
shalt save Israel." This was absolute and unqualified.
It left no room for Gideon's "wherewith?"
It made it very plain that the might with which he
was to deliver Israel was not in himself or in his
father's house, but in the God of Israel. It mattered
little whether his family was rich or poor; whether
he was little or great. It was God who was about
to use him? What was wealth or greatness to Him?
He could use a barley cake or a broken pitcher.
Indeed we may observe this special feature in the
varied instruments taken up in the book of Judges,
namely, that "no flesh shall glory in God's presence."
How does human glory fade away before
the humiliating fact that Israel's hosts were called
forth to battle under the leadership of a woman!
What a stain on human pride in the fact of deliverance
coming through the agency of a "left-handed
man"!</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, we find that just in proportion
as man's glory fades away, the divine glory
shines out. The humbler the instrument, the more
we see the power of God. What difference does it
make to the Almighty God whether His instrument
be left-handed or right-handed&mdash;a man or a woman&mdash;a
dwarf or a giant? The instrument is nothing:
God is all in all. True, He deigns to use instruments;
but all the power is His, and His shall be
the eternal and universal praise. Gideon had to
learn this; and so had Moses; and so have we all.
It is an invaluable lesson. We are all so prone to
think of <i>our</i> competency for any work or service
which may lie before us, when we ought to remember
that of all His works that are done upon the
earth, God is the doer of them. Our sufficiency is
of Him. We can do nothing; and if we could do
aught, it would be badly done. The human finger
can only leave a soil behind. The works of men
perish like their thoughts. The work of God abideth
forever. Let us remember these things, that we
may walk humbly and lean ever and only on the
mighty arm of the living God. Thus the soul is
kept in a well-balanced condition, free from self-confidence
and fleshly excitement, on the one
hand; and from gloom and depression, on the other.
If we can do nothing, self-confidence is the height
of presumption. If God can do every thing, despondency
is the height of folly.</p>

<p>But in the case of Gideon, as in that of all God's
servants, we observe two things worthy of our deepest
attention. In the first place, we have the divine
commission, as embodied in those weighty words,
"<i>Have not I sent thee?</i>" And in the second place,
we have the assurance of the divine presence, as set
forth in these encouraging words, "<i>Surely I will be
with thee</i>."</p>

<p>These are the two grand points for all who will
serve God in their day and generation. They must
know that the path they tread has been marked out
distinctly by the hand of God; and, furthermore,
they must have the sense of His presence with them
along the path. These things are absolutely essential.
Without them we shall waver and vacillate.
We shall be running from one line of work to another.
We shall take up certain work, go on with
it for a while, and then abandon it for something
else. We shall work by fits and starts; our course
will be faltering, our light flickering: "Unstable as
water, we shall not excel." We shall never succeed
at anything. There will be no certainty, no stability,
no progress.</p>

<p>These are weighty matters for all of us. It is of
immense importance for every servant of Christ,
every child of God, to know that he is at his divinely
appointed post, and at his divinely given work. This
will give fixedness of purpose, moral elevation, and
holy independence. It will preserve us from being
tossed about by human thoughts and opinions&mdash;being
influenced by the judgment of one or another.
It is our happy privilege to be so sure that we are
doing the very work which the Master has given us
to do, that the thoughts of our fellows respecting us
shall have no more weight with us than the pattering
of rain on the window.</p>

<p>Not&mdash;be it carefully observed&mdash;that we should,
for a moment countenance, much less cultivate, a
spirit of haughty independence. Far away be the
thought! We as Christians, can never, in one sense,
be independent one of another. How can we, seeing
we are members one of another? We are united
to one another and to our risen Head in glory, by
the one Spirit who is with us and in us. The most
intense individuality&mdash;and our individuality should
be as intense as our unity is indissoluble&mdash;can
never touch the precious truth of the one body and
one Spirit.</p>

<p>All this is divinely true, and most fully and thankfully
owned. But, at the same time, we must insist
upon the truth of our individuality, and of our personal
responsibility. This must be maintained with
all possible energy and decision. Each servant has
to do with his Lord, in that particular sphere of
work to which he has been called. And, moreover,
each should know his work, and give himself to it
diligently and constantly. He should possess the
holy certainty and authority imparted to the soul
by that divine and powerful sentence, "Have not I
sent thee?"</p>

<p>It will perhaps be said, "We are not all Gideons
or Joshuas. We are not all called to occupy such a
prominent place or tread such a brilliant path as
those illustrious servants." True; but we are called
to serve; and it is essential to every servant to know
his commission, to understand his work, and to be
fully assured in his own soul that he is doing the
very work which the Lord has given him to do, and
treading the very path which the hand of God has
marked out for him. If there be any uncertainly as
to this, we do not see how there can be any progress.</p>

<p>But there is more than this. It is not enough to
know that we are treading the divinely appointed
path. We want to realize the divine presence. We
want to have the precious words made good in our
experience, "Surely I will be with thee." This completes
the servant's equipment. The divine commission
and the divine presence are all we want;
but we must have these in order to get on. With
these priceless realities it matters not who we are.
The Lord can use a feeble woman, a left-handed man,
a cake of barley meal, or a broken pitcher. The
instrument is nothing. God is the workman. Unbelief
may cry out, "O my Lord, wherewith shall I
save Israel? Behold my family is <i>poor</i> in Manasseh,
and I am the <i>least</i> in my father's house." Faith
can cry out in reply, "What of all this if God be
for us? Does He want the rich or the noble? What
are riches or greatness to Him? Nothing." "Ye
see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise
men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
noble, are called; but God hath chosen the foolish
things of the world to confound the wise; and God
hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound
the things which are mighty; and base things
of the world, and things which are despised, hath
God chosen, yea, and things which are not to bring
to nought things that are: that no flesh should
glory in His presence" (1 Cor. i. 26-29).</p>

<p>These are wholesome words for all of us. It is
an unspeakable mercy for every dear servant of
Christ to be kept in the abiding sense of his own
utter nothingness&mdash;to be taught to realize, in some
measure, the depth, fulness, and power of that one
brief but most comprehensive statement, "Apart
from Me ye can do nothing." There is not a single
branch in all the vine, however imposing or wide-spreading
it may seem to be, which, if separated
from the parent stem by the thickness of a gold
leaf, can produce the very smallest atom of fruit.
There must be the abiding realization of our vital
union with Christ,&mdash;the practical, living, abiding in
Him, by faith, day by day, in order to bring forth
any fruit that God can accept. It is as we abide in
Christ that the living sap circulates freely through
us, and gives forth the healthy bud, the green leaf,
and the seasonable fruit.</p>

<p>Here lies the grand secret of power. It is abiding
in the living Vine. "Blessed is the man that
trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is;
for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and
that spreadeth out her roots by the river; and shall
not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be
green; and shall not be careful in the year of
drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit"
(Jer. xvii. 7, 8).</p>

<p>All this is intensely personal. We must each, for
himself and herself, cling by faith to Christ. It
is of the very first importance for Christians to
bear in mind that Christianity is a thoroughly
individual thing. We are individual in our repentance,
in our faith, in our salvation, in our communion,
in our service, and in our reward. Look at the
addresses to the seven churches in Rev. ii., iii.
Hearken to those pointed words, "<i>He</i> that hath an
ear,"&mdash;"To <i>him</i> that overcometh." What do they
mean? Do they not set forth, in the most distinct
and forcible manner, that blessed individuality of
which we speak? Unquestionably. But do they
touch unity? Not in the smallest degree. They
leave its sacred domain wholly untouched. "There
is one body and one Spirit." This must ever hold
good, spite of all the ruin and failure of the professing
Church. Nevertheless, the writings of John are
pre-eminently individual.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> From the opening lines
of his Gospel to the closing sentence of his Apocalypse,
we trace this feature. He shows us the
Philips, the Simons, the Andrews, and the Nathanaels
coming, in their individuality, to Jesus. He
tells us of a Jewish ruler here, and a Samaritan
sinner there, who were drawn by the Father to Jesus.
He tells us of the good Shepherd who calleth
His sheep by name. He tells us of the branches
clinging to the living Vine. Thus it is in John's
Gospel; and when we turn to his Epistles, we find
the same principle running through them all. He
writes to an elect lady, and to his beloved Gaius;
and if he once speaks of "the Church," it is but to
weep over its departed glory, and to raise amid its
ruins that warning note for individual ears, "<i>Look
to yourselves</i>." And as to the Revelation, it ends as
it begins, with a solemn appeal "<i>to him that heareth</i>."</p>


<h4>PART IV.</h4>

<p>The more closely we study the narrative of the
Lord's dealings with Gideon, the more we must be
struck with the marvelous way in which He prepares
him for his after course. Like all God's servants,
in all ages, Gideon had to undergo a course of
secret training and discipline, ere he was fit to appear
in public. The space of time occupied in this
training may vary, as may also the character of the
discipline; but of this we may rest assured that all
who will be used of God in public must be taught
of God in private. It is a fatal mistake for any one
to rush into prominence without proper equipment,
and that equipment can only be attained in the
secret of the divine presence. It is in profound and
hallowed retirement with God that vessels are filled,
and instruments fitted for His work.</p>

<p>Let us never forget this. Moses had to spend
forty years at "the back side of the desert" ere he
was fit to enter upon his public career. David had
to feed his father's flock, ere he was called to rule
the nation of Israel. He slew a lion and a bear in
secret, ere he was called to slay Goliath in public.
The great apostle of the Gentiles spent three years
in Arabia, notwithstanding his very remarkable conversion
and call. The apostles spent three years
and a half in companionship with their Master, and
then had to tarry until they were endued with power
from on high. Thus it has been with all those who
have ever been called to occupy a prominent place
in the Lord's work; and even the blessed Master
Himself&mdash;though surely needing no training or discipline,
inasmuch as He was ever perfect,&mdash;to set
us an example, spent thirty years in retirement ere
He came forth in public.</p>

<p>All this is full of most wholesome instruction for
our souls. Let us seek to take it in and profit by
it. No one can ever get on in public work without
this private teaching in the school of Christ. It is
this which gives depth, solidity, and mellowness to
the character. It imparts a tone of reality and a
fixedness of purpose most desirable in all who engage
in any department of the Lord's work. It will
invariably be found that where anyone goes to work
without this divine preparation, there is shallowness
and instability. There may perhaps for a time be
more flash and show in those superficial characters
than in those who have been educated in the school
of Christ; but it never lasts. It may create a momentary
sensation, but it soon passes away like the
morning cloud or the early dew. Nothing will stand
but that which is the direct result of private communion
with God&mdash;secret training in His presence&mdash;the
excellent discipline of the school of God.</p>

<p>Let us see how all this is exemplified in Gideon's
case. It is very evident that this honored servant
was called to pass through deep exercises of soul
before ever he took a single step in public action,
yea, before he ever unfurled the standard of testimony
in his father's house. He had to begin with
himself, with his own personal condition, with his
own heart. Those who will be used for others must
begin with themselves. So Gideon found it. Let
us pursue his history.</p>

<p>"And the Lord said unto Gideon, Surely I will be
with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as
one man. And he said unto Him, If now I have
found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that
thou talkest with me. Depart not hence, I pray thee,
until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present,
and set it before thee. And He said, I will tarry till
thou come again. And Gideon went in and made
ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of
flour; the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the
broth in a pot, and brought it out unto Him under
the oak, and presented it. And the angel of God
said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened
cakes; and lay them upon this rock, and pour out
the broth. And he did so. Then the angel of the
Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his
hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened
cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock and
consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then
the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.
And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel
of the Lord, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! for
because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to
face. And the Lord said unto him, Peace be unto
thee; fear not: thou shalt not die" (Judges vi.
16-23).</p>

<p>Here we reach a profoundly interesting stage of
Gideon's preparatory course. He is called to enter
practically and experimentally into the great and
universal law for the servants of God, namely,
"When I am weak, then I am strong." This is a
most precious law, and one which forms an indispensable
element in the education of all Christ's
servants. Let no one imagine that he can ever be
used in the Lord's work, or ever make progress in
the divine life, without some measure of real entrance
into this invaluable principle. We hold it to
be absolutely essential in forming the character of
the true servant of Christ. Where it is not known,
where it has not been felt, where it has not been to
some extent realized, there is sure to be unsubduedness,
unbrokenness, self-occupation, in some form
or another. There will be more or less of self-confidence,
and various points and angles turning up
here and there, and acting as a sad hindrance to all
that is good, useful, and holy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when one has learnt that great
family motto quoted above&mdash;when one has learnt, in
the divine presence to say, "When I am weak, then
I am strong,"&mdash;when nature has been weighed in
the balance of the sanctuary, there you will always
find a measure of brokenness, softness, and tenderness
of spirit; and not only so, but also largeness
of heart, and readiness for every good work, and
that lovely elasticity of mind which enables one to
rise above all those petty, selfish considerations,
which so sadly hinder the work of God. In short,
the heart must first be broken, then made whole;
and, being made whole, be undividedly given to
Christ and to His blessed service. It is impossible
to run the eye along the brilliant array of Christ's
workmen, and not see the truth of this. Moses,
Joshua, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and
Daniel, in Old Testament times; and Peter, Paul,
and John, in those of the New, all stand before us
as vivid illustrations of the value of broken material.
All those beloved and honored servants had
to be broken in order to be made whole&mdash;to be emptied
in order to be filled&mdash;to learn that, of themselves,
they could do nothing, in order to be ready,
in Christ's strength, for anything and everything.</p>

<p>Such is the law of the household&mdash;the law of the
vineyard&mdash;the law of the kingdom. So Gideon found
it in his day. His "alas!" was followed by Jehovah's
"Peace; fear not," and then he was ready to
begin. He had been brought face to face with the
angel of God, and there he learnt not only that his
family was poor in Manasseh, and he the least in
his father's house, but that in himself he was perfectly
powerless, and that all his springs must be
found in the living God. Priceless lesson this, for
the son of Joash, and for us all!&mdash;a lesson not to be
learnt in the schools and colleges of this world, but
only in the deep and holy retirement of the sanctuary
of God.</p>

<p>And now let us see what was Gideon's first act
after his fears were hushed, and his soul filled with
divine peace. His very first act was to build an
altar. "Then Gideon built an altar there unto the
Lord, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day
it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites." He takes
the happy place of a worshiper, and his worship is
characterized by the revelation of the divine character.
He calls his altar by that precious title, "The
Lord send peace." He had gone through many and
deep exercises of soul&mdash;exercises which none can
know save those who are called out into a prominent
place amongst God's people. He felt the ruin
and the weakness of all around him. He felt the
fallen and humiliating condition of his beloved people.
He felt his own littleness, yea, his own emptiness,
and nothingness. How could he come forward?
How could he smite the Midianites? How
could he save Israel? Who was sufficient for these
things? It is all very well for those persons who live
an easy, irresponsible kind of life; who know not
the toils, the cares, and anxieties connected with
the public service of Christ and the testimony for
His name in an evil day. These know nothing of
Gideon's painful exercises of soul; nothing of the
pressure upon his spirit as he looked forth from beneath
the shade of his father's oak-tree, and contemplated
the dangers and responsibilities of the
battle-field. They can enter but feebly into the
meaning of those words of one high up in the school
of Christ, "We had the sentence of death in ourselves
that we should not trust in ourselves, but in
God who raiseth the dead."</p>

<p>These are weighty words for all Christ's servants;
but we must be His servants in reality, in order to
enter into their deep significance. If we are content
to live a life of indolence and ease, a life of self-seeking
and self-pleasing, it is impossible for us to
understand such words, or indeed to enter into any
of those intense exercises of soul through which
Christ's true-hearted servants and faithful witnesses,
in all ages, have been called to pass. We invariably
find that all those who have been most used of God
in public have gone through deep waters in secret.
It is as the sentence of death is written practically
upon <i>self</i>, that the power of resurrection-life in Christ
shines out. Thus Paul could say to the Corinthians,
"Death worketh in us; but life in you." Marvelous
words! Words which let us into the profound depths
of the apostle's ministry. What a ministry must that
have been which was carried on upon such a principle
as this! What power! what energy! Death
working in the poor earthen vessel, but streams of
life, heavenly grace, and spiritual power flowing
into those to whom he ministered.</p>

<p>This, reader, we may depend upon it, is the true
secret of all effective ministry. It is an easy matter
to talk about ministry; to set up to be ministers of
Christ; but oh, how has the professing Church departed
from the divine reality of ministry! Alas!
the heart sinks at the bare thought of it. Where are
the Pauls, the Gideons, and the Joshuas? Where
are the deep heart-searchings and profound soul
exercises which have characterized Christ's servants
in other days? We are flippant and wordy, shallow
and empty, self-sufficient and self-indulgent. Need
we wonder at the small results? How can we expect
to see life working in others when we know so
little about death working in us?</p>

<p>May the eternal Spirit stir us all up, and work in
us a more powerful sense of what it is to be the
true-hearted, single-eyed, devoted servants of Jesus
Christ!</p>


<h4>PART V.</h4>

<p>We are now to contemplate Gideon called forth
into action. He has received his commission from
Jehovah. His questions have been answered, his
fears hushed, his heart tranquilized, and he is enabled
to build an altar. All this had reference to
his own personal condition, to the state of his own
soul, to the attitude of his own heart as in the sight
of God.</p>

<p>Thus it must ever be. We must all begin in this
way, if we are ever to be used of God to act on
others. We must have to do with God in the secret
of our own souls, else we shall prove to be but sorry
workmen in the sequel. All who go forth in public
work without this secret training, are sure to prove
flimsy and shallow. Self must be measured in the
divine presence. We must learn that nature is of no
account in the Lord's work. "Not by might, nor
by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts"
(Zech. iv. 6).</p>

<p>It was not until Gideon had gone through somewhat
of this holy discipline in secret that he was led
out into service. And let us carefully note where
he had to commence. "It came to pass the same
night, that the Lord said unto him, Take thy father's
young bullock, even the second bullock, of seven
years old"&mdash;for Jehovah knew how many bullocks
Joash had, and the age of each&mdash;"and throw down
the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down
the grove that is by it. And build an altar unto
the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock, in the
ordered place, and take the second bullock, and
offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove
which thou shalt cut down."</p>

<p>Here we see that Gideon had to begin <i>at home</i>.
He was called to unfurl the standard of testimony in
the very bosom of his family&mdash;in the very centre of
his father's house. This is intensely interesting,
and deeply practical. It teaches a lesson to which
we should all bend our ears and apply our hearts.
Testimony must begin at home. It will never do to
rush forth into public work while our private and
domestic ways are anything but what they ought to
be. It is useless to set about throwing down the
altar of Baal in public, while the selfsame altar remains
standing at home.</p>

<p>This is of the very first importance. We are all
of us imperatively called upon to show piety at home.
Nothing is more sorrowful than to meet with persons
who, abroad amongst their fellow men or their fellow
Christians, are marked by a high tone of spirituality&mdash;a
style of speaking which would lead one to
suppose them far beyond the ordinary level of Christians,
and yet when you come to close quarters with
them&mdash;when you become acquainted with their private
life and ways, their actual history from day to
day, you find them very far indeed from bearing
testimony for Christ to those with whom they come
in contact. This is most deplorable. It dishonors
the Lord Jesus, grieves the Spirit, stumbles and repulses
young believers, gives occasion to the enemy
to speak reproachfully, and to our brethren to speak
doubtfully of us.</p>

<p>Surely these things ought not to be. There ought
to be a testimony yielded at home. Those who see
most of us should see most of Christ in us. Those
who know us best ought best to know that we are
Christ's. But alas! how often is it otherwise! How
often the home circle is just the place where the
lovely traits of Christian character are least exhibited!
The wife or the husband, the parent or
the child, the brother or the sister, the master or the
servant, the fellow-servant or some other companion
in daily life, is just the one in whose sight we least
display the beauteous fruits of divine life. It is in
private life that all our weak points come out&mdash;our
oddities and peculiarities, our silly tendencies and
sinful tempers: instead of which it ought to be in
that very sphere that the grace of Jesus is most
faithfully manifested.</p>

<p>Christian reader, let us not turn away from the
word of reproof, of admonition, or exhortation. It may
not be pleasant; but, we may rest assured, it is salutary.
It may not be agreeable to the flesh; but it is
wholesome to the soul. We are called, like Gideon,
to begin at home, if we would prove helpful to our
brethren, or act effectively against the common foe.</p>

<p>No doubt there are difficulties involved in this
home testimony. It is often very hard, for example,
for a child to bear witness against the worldliness
of a parent, or of the whole family; but where there
is humility of mind and simple dependence upon
God, He maintains and carries us through marvelously.
One thing is certain, there is nothing like
decision. "The first blow is half the battle," yea,
the whole battle is often gained by a single blow,
when that blow is dealt in full communion with the
mind of Christ.</p>

<p>On the other hand, where there is weakness and
vacillation&mdash;playing fast and loose with the truth of
God, trifling with divine principles and one's own
conscience, a looking at consequences and a weighing
of probable results&mdash;there the enemy is sure to
have the upper hand, and the testimony altogether
fails. God acts with those who act for Him. This
is the grand secret of their success; but where the
eye is not single, there is no real progress, no divine
result.</p>

<p>Here is where so many of us signally fail. We
are not whole hearted, not decided, not thoroughly
out-and-out for Christ. Hence there is no result
for God, no action on others. We have no idea of
what may be accomplished by a single devoted heart,
one earnest and energetic soul. Such an one may
be used to raise up a standard round which thousands
will flock who might never have had the
courage or energy to unfurl the standard themselves.</p>

<p>Look at Gideon. See how he wrought for God,
and how God wrought with him. "Then Gideon took
ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had
said unto him; and so it was, because he feared his
father's household, and the men of the city, that he
could not do it by day, that he did it by night. And
when the men of the city rose early in the morning,
behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the
grove was cut down that was by it, and the second
bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
And they said one to another, Who hath done this
thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said,
Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. Then
the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy
son that he may die; because he hath cast down the
altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the
grove that was by it."</p>

<p>This is what we may call striking at the very root
of the matter. The worship of Baal is completely
overturned. This was no trifle. We have little idea
of what it cost the son of Joash to do this thing;
but by the grace of God he did it. True, it may
have been with fear and trembling, still he did it.
He dealt one vigorous blow at the entire system of
Baal, and it crumbled into dust beneath his feet.
No half measures would have availed. It would
have been of no possible use to pick a stone here
and there out of the idol's altar; the whole fabric
had to be overturned from its very foundation, and
the idol itself degraded in the very presence of its
deluded worshipers. A bold decisive stroke was
needed, and that stroke was given by the hand of
Gideon the son of Joash, God's "mighty man of
valor."</p>

<p>There is nothing, we repeat, like plain decision&mdash;bold,
uncompromising faithfulness for Christ, cost
what it may. Had Gideon been less decided, had
his line of action been less thorough, his father
Joash would not have been so perfectly won over.
It needed just such a method of dealing with Baal
to convince a rational person that the worship of
such a god was a sham and a falsehood. "And
Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye
plead for Baal? <i>will ye save him?</i> he that will plead
for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet
morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself,
because one hath cast down his altar. Therefore
on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let
Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown
down his altar."</p>

<p>This was very simple reasoning, "If he be a god,
let him plead for himself." Gideon's decided course
had brought matters to a point. Baal was either a
reality or a most complete delusion. If the former,
let him plead for himself. If the latter, who would
think of pleading for him? Nothing could be simpler.
Gideon's action was a complete success. The
worship of Baal was overturned; and the worship
of Jehovah Elohim set up instead.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the divine work in the soul of
Gideon is making very rapid but very real progress.
He is conducted from strength to strength. How
little idea had he, when first the divine voice fell on
his ear, that, in so short a time, he would take so
bold a step. If any one had said to him then, "In
a few hours you will overturn the worship of Baal
in the very midst of your father's house," he would
not have believed it. But the Lord led him along,
step by step, gently yet firmly; and as the heavenly
light broke in upon his soul, his confidence and
courage grew.</p>

<p>Thus it is the Lord ever deals with His servants.
He does not expect them to run before they have
learnt to walk; but where the heart is true, and the
purpose honest and firm, He graciously supplies the
needed strength, moment by moment. He causes
mountains of difficulty to remove, rolls away many
a dark and heavy cloud, fortifies the heart, and girds
up the loins of the mind, so that the very feeblest
are armed with giant strength, and the coward heart
filled with wonder, love, and praise at the triumph
of divine grace.</p>

<p>Having broken down Baal's altar, Gideon is now
led to encounter Midian's hosts. "Then all the
Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
the east were gathered together, and went over, and
pitched in the valley of Jezreel. But the Spirit of
the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet,
and Abi-ezer was gathered after him. And he sent
messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also was
gathered after him; and he sent messengers unto
Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and
they came up to meet them."</p>

<p>In short there was a thorough awakening. The
tide of spiritual energy rose majestically, and bore
hundreds and thousands upon its bosom. The
work which had begun in Gideon's heart was extending
itself far and wide, throughout the length
and breadth of the land. The Spirit of the Lord
was displaying His mighty energy, and multitudes
were stirred up to gather round the standard which
the hand of faith had unfurled.</p>

<p>But just at this point, it would seem that Gideon's
faith needed fresh confirmation. It may be his
spirit was overawed when he saw the mighty host
of the uncircumcised mustering before him; and
then, for a moment, his courage failed, and his heart
craved a fresh sign from the Lord. "And Gideon
said unto God, If Thou wilt save Israel by my
hand, <i>as Thou hast said</i>"&mdash;alas! the poor heart can
place its unbelieving "if" right in front of the word
of God who cannot lie&mdash;"behold, I will put a fleece
of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece
only, and if it be dry upon all the earth beside, <i>then
shall I know</i> that Thou wilt save Israel by mine
hand, <i>as Thou hast said</i>."</p>

<p>How marvelous! And yet we need not marvel
if we know aught of our own hearts. Anything for
the poor human heart but the naked word of the
living God. A sign, a token, something that the
eye can see. The word of God is not enough for
unbelieving nature.</p>

<p>But oh! the matchless grace of God! His unupbraiding
love! His tender considerateness! He
graciously meets the weakness of His poor servant,
for "It was so: for he rose up early on the
morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed
the dew out of the fleece, <i>a bowl full of water</i>."
What condescending grace! Instead of severely
rebuking Gideon's unbelieving "if," He graciously
confirms his wavering faith by superabounding
evidence.</p>

<p>And yet all this sufficed not. Gideon seeks still
further confirmation. "And he said unto God, Let
not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak
but this once. Let me prove, I pray Thee, but this
once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon
the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
And God did so that night: for it was dry upon
the fleece only, and there was dew upon all the
ground." Such is the abounding grace and
patience of the God with whom we have to do.
Forever adored be His holy Name! Who would
not trust Him, and love Him, and serve Him?</p>


<h4>PART VI.</h4>

<p>We shall now ask the reader to open his Bible at
the seventh chapter of the book of Judges. Here
Gideon's companions are brought before us; and
their history, as well as that of their leader, is full
of interest and profit for us. They had to be trained
and tested as well as he. Let us ponder the narrative.</p>

<p>"Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the
people that were with him, rose up early and pitched
beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the
Midianites were on the north side of them, by the
hill of Moreh, in the valley. And the Lord said
unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too
many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands,
lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying,
Mine own hand hath saved me."</p>

<p>The clear and soul-stirring blast of Gideon's
trumpet had drawn around him a very large and
imposing company; but this company had to be
tested. It is one thing to be moved by the zeal
and energy of some earnest servant of Christ, and
it is quite another thing to possess those moral qualities
which alone can fit a man to be an earnest
servant himself. There is a vast difference between
following in the wake of some devoted man of God,
and walking with God ourselves&mdash;being propped up
and led on by the faith and energy of another, and
leaning upon God in the power of individual faith
for ourselves.</p>

<p>This is a serious consideration for all of us.
There is always great danger of our being mere
imitators of other people's faith; of copying their
example without their spiritual power; of adopting
their peculiar line of things without their personal
communion. All this must be carefully guarded
against. We specially warn the young Christian
reader against it. Let us be simple, and humble,
and real. We may be very <i>small</i>, our sphere very
narrow, our path very retired; but it does not matter
in the least, provided we are precisely what grace
has made us, and occupying the sphere in which
our blessed Master has set us, and treading the path
which He has opened before us. It is by no means
absolutely necessary that we should be great, or
prominent, or showy, or noisy in the world; but it
is absolutely necessary that we should be real and
humble, obedient and dependent. Thus our God
can use us, without fear of our vaunting ourselves;
and then, too, we are safe, peaceful, and happy.
There is nothing more delightful to the true Christian,
the genuine servant of Christ, than to find
himself in that quiet, humble, shady path where <i>self</i>
is lost sight of, and the precious light of God's
countenance enjoyed&mdash;where the thoughts of men
are of small account, and the sweet approval of
Christ is everything to the soul.</p>

<p>Flesh cannot be trusted. It will turn the very
service of Christ into an occasion of self-exaltation.
It will use the very name of Him who made Himself
nothing in order to make itself something. It
will build up its own reputation by seeming to further
the cause of Him who made Himself of none.
Such is flesh! Such are we in ourselves! Silly,
self-exalting creatures, ever ready to vaunt ourselves,
while professing to be nothing in ourselves, and to
deserve nothing but the flames of an everlasting hell.</p>

<p>Need we marvel at the testing and proving of
Gideon's companions? All must be tested and
proved. The service of Christ is a very solemn and
a very holy thing; and all who take part therein
must be self-judged, self-distrusting, and self-emptied;
and not only so, but they must lean, with unshaken
confidence, upon the living God. These are
the grand qualities that go to make up the character
of the true servant of Christ, and they are strikingly
illustrated on the page of inspiration which now lies
open before us.</p>

<p>Let us proceed with the narrative.</p>

<p>"The people that are with thee are too many for
Me to give the Midianites into their hands....
Now, therefore, go to, proclaim in the ears of the
people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let
him return and depart early from mount Gilead.
And there returned of the people twenty and two
thousand; and there remained ten thousand."</p>

<p>Here the first grand test is applied to Gideon's
host&mdash;a test designed to bring out the measure of
the heart's simple confidence in Jehovah. A coward
heart will not do for the day of battle; a doubting
spirit will not stand in conflict. The same principle
is set forth in Deuteronomy xx. 8: "And the officers
shall speak further unto the people, and they shall
say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted?
let him go and return unto his house, lest
his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart."</p>

<p>Faint-heartedness is terribly contagious. It spreads
rapidly. It withers the arm that should bear the
shield, and paralyses the hand that should wield the
sword. The only cure for this malady is simple
confidence in God, a firm grasp of His faithfulness,
a child-like trust in His word, true personal acquaintance
with Himself. We must know God for
ourselves, in such a way that His word is everything
to us, and that we can walk alone with Him, and
stand alone with Him in the darkest hour.</p>

<p>Reader, is it thus with thee? Hast thou this
blessed confidence in God&mdash;this solid hold of His
word? Hast thou, deep down in thy heart, such an
experimental knowledge of God and His Christ as
shall sustain thee even though thou hadst not the
support or sympathy of another believer under the
sun? Art thou prepared to walk alone in the world?</p>

<p>These are weighty questions, and we feel the need
of pressing them upon the Church of God at the
present moment. There is a wide diffusion of the
precious truth of God, and numbers are getting hold
of it. Like the blast of Gideon's trumpet, so the
clear testimony which has widely gone forth of
late years has attracted many; and while we quite
feel that there is real ground for thankfulness in this,
we also feel that there is ground for very serious reflection
indeed. Truth is a most precious thing, if
it be truthfully found and truthfully held: but let us
remember that in exact proportion to the preciousness
of the truth of God so is the moral danger of
trafficking therein without a self-judged heart and an
exercised conscience. What we really need is faith&mdash;unfeigned,
earnest, simple faith, which connects the
soul, in living power, with God, and enables us to
overcome all the difficulties and discouragements of
the way. Of this faith there can be no imitation.
We must either possess it in reality or not at all. A
sham faith will speedily come to the ground. The
man who attempts to walk by faith, if he have it
not, must speedily totter and fall. We cannot face
the hosts of Midian unless we have full confidence
in the living God. "Whosoever is fearful and
afraid, let him return." Thus it must ever be.
None can go to battle save those who are braced up
by a faith that grasps the unseen realities of eternity,
and endures as seeing Him who is invisible. May
this faith be ours, in larger measure, beloved reader.</p>

<p>It is full of instruction for the heart to notice the
effect of the first test upon the host of Gideon. It
thinned his ranks amazingly. "There returned of
the people twenty and two thousand, and there remained
ten thousand." This was a serious reduction.
But it is far better to have ten thousand that
can trust God than ten thousand times ten thousand
who cannot. Of what use are numbers, if they be
not energized by a living faith? None whatever.
It is comparatively easy to flock around a standard
raised by a vigorous hand; but it is a totally different
thing to stand, in personal energy, in the
actual battle. Nought but genuine faith can do
this; and hence when the searching question is put,
"Who can trust God?" the showy ranks of profession
are speedily thinned.</p>

<p>But there was yet another test for Gideon's companions.
"And the Lord said unto Gideon, The
people are yet too many; bring them down unto the
water, and I will try them for thee there: and it
shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall
go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of
whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with
thee, the same shall not go. So he brought down
the people unto the water: and the Lord said unto
Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with
his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by
himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon
his knees to drink. And the number of them that
lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were
three hundred men: but all the rest of the people
bowed down upon their knees to drink water. And
the Lord said unto Gideon, By the three hundred
men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the
Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other
people go every man unto his place" (vii. 4-7).</p>

<p>Here then we have another great moral quality
which must characterize those who will act for God
and His people, in an evil day. They must not
only have confidence in God, but they must also be
prepared to surrender self. This is a universal law
in the service of Christ. If we want to swim in
God's current, we must sink self; and we can only
sink self in proportion as we trust Christ. It is not,
need we say, a question of salvation; it is a question
of service. It is not a question of being a child of
God, but of being a proper servant of Christ. The
thirty-one thousand seven hundred that were dismissed
from Gideon's army, were just as much
Israelites as the three hundred that remained; but
they were not fitted for the moment of conflict:
they were not the right men for the crisis. And
why? Was it that they were not circumcised? Nay.
What then? They could not trust God and surrender
self. They were full of fear when they ought to
have been full of faith. They made refreshment
and comfort their object instead of conflict.</p>

<p>Here, reader, lay the true secret of their moral
unfitness. God cannot trust those who do not trust
Him and sink self. This is pre-eminently solemn
and practical. We live in a day of easy profession
and self-indulgence. Knowledge can, now-a-days,
be picked up at very small cost. Scraps of truth
can be gathered, second hand, in all directions.
Truth which cost some of God's dear servants years
of deep soul-ploughing and heart-searching exercise,
is now in free circulation and can be intellectually
seized and flippantly professed, by many who know
not what soul-ploughing or heart-exercise means.</p>

<p>But let us never forget&mdash;yea, let us constantly remember&mdash;that
the life of faith is a reality; service
is a reality; testimony for Christ, a reality. And
further let us bear in mind that if we want to stand
for Christ in an evil day&mdash;if we would be men for
the crisis, genuine servants, true witnesses&mdash;then
verily we must learn the true meaning of those
two qualities, namely, confidence in God, and self-surrender.</p>


<h4>PART VII.</h4>

<p>There is something peculiarly striking in the fact
that out of the many thousands of Israel, in the days
of Gideon, there were only three hundred men who
were really fit for conflict with the Midianites; only
this small band fit for the occasion. This truly is
a suggestive and admonitory fact. There were
hundreds of thousands of true Israelites&mdash;truly circumcised
sons of Abraham&mdash;members of the congregation
of the Lord, who were by no means up to
the mark, when it was a question of war to the knife
with Midian&mdash;a question of genuine confidence in
God and self-surrender. We are safe in saying that
the men who were morally fitted for the grand crisis
in the day of battle were not one in a thousand.
How solemn! Not one in a thousand who could
trust God and deny self.</p>

<p>Christian reader, is not this something worthy of
deep and serious thought? Does it not, very naturally,
suggest the inquiry as to whether it is otherwise
at this moment? Is it not painfully evident
that we live in a day in the which little is known of
the blessed secret of confidence in God, and still
less of the exercise of self-surrender? In point of
fact, these things can never be rightly separated.
If we attempt to divorce self-surrender from confidence
in God, it will land us in the deep and dark
delusions of monasticism, asceticism, or ritualism.
It will issue in nature trying to subdue nature.
This, we need hardly say, is the direct opposite of
Christianity. This latter starts with the glorious
fact that the <i>old self</i> has been condemned and set
aside by the cross of Christ, and therefore it can be
practically surrendered, every day, by the power of
the Holy Ghost. This is the meaning of those fine
words in Colossians iii., "Ye <i>are</i> dead, and your
life is hid with Christ in God." He does not say,
"Ye <i>ought to be</i> dead." No; but "ye <i>are</i> dead."
What then? "Mortify your members which are on
the earth." So also in the profound and precious
teaching in Romans vi., "How shall we that <i>are</i>
dead to sin, live any longer therein? Know ye not,
that so many of us as were baptized unto Jesus
Christ were baptized unto His death?" What then?
"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed
unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus
Christ our Lord."</p>

<p>Here then lies the secret of all true self-surrender.
If this be not understood and practically entered
into, it will simply be <i>self</i> in one form trying to subdue
<i>self</i> in another. This is a fatal delusion. It is
a snare of the devil into which earnest souls are in
imminent danger of falling, who sigh after holiness
of life, but do not know the power of accomplished
redemption, and the indwelling of the Holy Ghost&mdash;are
not built upon the solid foundation of Christianity.</p>

<p>We specially warn the reader against this insidious
error. It distinctly savors of monasticism or
asceticism. It clothes itself in the garb of pietism
and sanctimoniousness, and is peculiarly attractive
to a certain class of ardent spirits who long for victory
over the lusts, passions, and tendencies of nature;
but, not knowing how to attain it, are turning
their back upon Christ and His cross, and betaking
themselves to the resources of a spurious religion.</p>

<p>It is against this most mischievous and delusive
system that the apostle warns us, in Colossians ii.,
"Let no man," he says, "beguile you of your reward
in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels,
intruding into those things which he hath not seen,
vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, and not holding
the head, from which all the body by joints and
bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together,
increaseth with the increase of God. Wherefore
if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments
of the world, why, as though living in the world,
are ye subject to ordinances"&mdash;such as, "touch not;
taste not; handle not; which all are to perish with
the using&mdash;after the commandments and doctrines of
men? Which things have indeed a show of wisdom
in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the
body; not in any honor to the satisfying of the
flesh" (Colossians ii. 18-23).</p>

<p>We deem it needful to say thus much lest any of
our readers should at all mistake us on the subject
of self-surrender. We desire it to be distinctly
understood that the only possible ground of self-surrender
is the knowledge of accomplished redemption,
and our union with Christ through the power
of the Holy Ghost. This is the essential basis of
all Christian conduct. In short, a known salvation
is the basis; the Holy Ghost indwelling, the power;
and the word of God, the directory of all true self-surrender.</p>

<p>But what did Gideon and his companions know
of these things? Nothing, as Christians now know
them. But they had confidence in God, and further,
they did not make their own refreshment or comfort
their object, but simply took it up by the way as a
means to an end. Herein they teach a fine lesson
even to those whose privilege it is to walk in the
full light of New Testament Christianity. If they,
in the dim twilight in which they lived, could trust
God, and surrender self for the moment, even in
measure, then what shall we say for ourselves who,
with all our light and privileges, are so ready to
doubt God and seek our own things?</p>

<p>Is it not painfully evident that, in this our day of
light and privilege, there is but little moral preparedness
for the path of service and conflict which we
are called to tread? Alas! alas! we cannot deny
it. There is a deplorable lack of genuine trust in
the living God, and of the true spirit of self-surrender.
Here, we may rest assured, is the deep secret
of the whole matter. God is not practically known
and habitually trusted; self is exalted and indulged.
Hence our unfitness for the warfare, our failure in
the day of battle. It is one thing to be saved, and
quite another thing to be a soldier; and we cannot
shake off the painful conviction that, in this day of
widely extended profession, the proportion of workmen
and warriors would not be found a whit greater
than it was in the days of Gideon and his companions.
The fact is, we want men of faith, men
whose hearts are fixed and their eyes single; men
so absorbed with Christ and His cause that they
have no time for aught beside. We greatly fear
that, if the double test which was applied to Israel
in the days of Gideon, were to be applied now to
those who stand on the very highest platform of
profession, the practical result would not differ very
materially.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We shall only touch on two more leading points,
and then leave our readers to meditate closely upon
the whole subject for themselves.</p>

<p>The close of Judges vii. shews us Gideon and his
companions completely victorious. "The cake of
barley bread," and "the broken pitchers," proved
a match for all the power of the Midianites, although
they "lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for
multitude, and their camels were without number,
as the sand by the sea-side for multitude." God
was with those represented by the cake of barley
bread and broken pitchers, as He will ever be with
those who are prepared to take the low place; prepared
to be nothing, but to make Him their all in
all; prepared to trust Him and to sink self. This,
let it never be forgotten, is the great root principle
in all service and in all conflict. Without it, we can
never succeed; with it, we can never fail. It matters
not what the difficulties, or what the numbers and
power of our enemies, all must give way before the
presence of the living God; and that presence will
ever accompany those who trust Him and sink self.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. Not only is firm trust in God
and self-surrender the secret of victory over external
enemies; it is also the secret of overcoming, disarming,
and melting down proud and jealous brethren,
though these latter are often far more difficult
to deal with than open enemies. Thus no sooner
had Gideon reached the point of victory over the
uncircumcised, than he was called to encounter the
petty and contemptible jealousy of his brethren,
"And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast
thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not when
thou wentest to fight the Midianites? And they
did chide with him sharply" (chapter viii. 1).</p>

<p>All this was most uncalled for and unworthy.
Had they not heard the sound of the trumpet calling
Israel to the battle field? Had they not heard
that the standard was unfurled? Why had they not
rushed to the battle at the first? It was an easy
matter to come in at the close and reap the spoil,
and then find fault with the one who had been God's
real instrument on the occasion.</p>

<p>However, we shall not dwell upon the unlovely
conduct of the men of Ephraim; but turn, for a moment,
to the exquisite way in which Gideon was
enabled to meet them. "And he said unto them,
What have I done now in comparison of you?...
God hath delivered into your hands the princes of
Midian, Oreb, and Zeeb; and what was I able to
do in comparison of you? Then their anger was
abated toward him when he had said that."</p>

<p>Here, Christian reader, is the true way to vanquish
jealous and envious brethren. The cake of
barley bread and the broken pitcher can vanquish
jealous Ephraimites as well as hostile Midianites.
A self-hiding spirit is the grand secret of victory
over envy and jealousy, in all their odious forms.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to quarrel with a
man who is down in the dust, in true self-abasement.
"What have I done now in comparison of you?"
This is the language of one who had learnt something
of the real meaning of self-surrender; and we
may safely assert that such language must ever disarm
the envy and jealousy of the self-occupied and
self-sufficient. May we know more of the truth of
this!</p>

<p>We must now look at the closing scene of Gideon's
remarkable history&mdash;a scene full of admonition
for every servant of Christ. From it we learn
that it is easier to gain a victory than to make a
good use of it; easier to reach a position than to
occupy it aright. We shall quote the passage.
"Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule
thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's
son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand
of Midian. And Gideon said unto them, I will not
rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you:
the Lord shall rule over you."</p>

<p>So far, this was very fine. It was in full keeping
with the self-surrender of Gideon's previous course.
Every true servant of Christ will ever seek to connect
souls with his Master, and not with himself.
Gideon would not indeed displace Jehovah as the
ruler of Israel. But, alas! his great victory fills his
mind, and he will make a perpetual glory of it by
an ephod (a priestly garment) of gold; and this,
simply because his self-surrender was not complete.
There has been but One whose self-surrender was,
and that One must, in all things, have the pre-eminence.
"And Gideon said unto them, I would
desire a request of you, that ye would give me every
man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden
earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) And they
answered, We will willingly give them. And they
spread a garment, and did cast therein every man
the earrings of his prey.... And Gideon made
an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in
Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after
it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and
to his house" (chapter viii. 22-27).</p>

<p>Such is man, even the best of men, when left to
himself. Here we see the very man who had led
his brethren on to victory over Midian, now leading
them into dark and abominable idolatry. The earrings
of the Ishmaelites did what their swords could
not do; and the love-tokens of the men of Israel
proved far more dangerous than the sharp chidings
of the men of Ephraim. The latter drew out a lovely
spirit of self-emptiness: the former proved a snare
to Gideon and to the whole house of Israel.</p>

<p>Reader, let us remember all this. If Gideon had
refused the earrings as well as the throne, it would
have been well for him and for his brethren; but
the devil laid a snare for him into which he fell and
carried all his brethren with him. May we all take
warning from Gideon's fall, and draw encouragement
from Gideon's victories. May we remember
that it is one thing to gain a victory, and another
to make good use of it; it is easier to reach a position
than to occupy it aright. May God grant to
the reader and writer of these lines, more simple
confidence in Himself, and more of the true spirit
of self-surrender! May such be the result of our
meditations upon Gideon and his companions.</p>

<h2>ETERNAL PUNISHMENT</h2>


<p>We have received a communication on the deeply
solemn subject of eternal punishment, from a
person whose initials are "C. D. S.," and who would seem
to be the exponent of the feelings of a very numerous
class. Our correspondent does not, by any means, write
as an objector, or a caviler, but as an honest inquirer;
and we are not sorry to be called upon to bear a clear and
decided testimony on a point of such grave moment. He
asks us to let him know "what the Holy Ghost has taught
us on the subject," and we cheerfully comply.</p>

<p>We believe the Word of God most clearly and fully
teaches the eternity of punishment. The word which is
rendered "everlasting," or "eternal," occurs about seventy
times in the New Testament. We shall give some
examples. "To be cast into <i>everlasting</i> fire." (Matt. xviii.
8.) "That I may have <i>eternal</i> life." (Matt. xix. 16.)
"These shall go away into <i>everlasting</i> punishment." (Matt.
xxv. 46.) And in the same verse, "The righteous unto
life <i>eternal</i>." "Is in danger of <i>eternal</i> damnation." (Mark
iii. 29.) "They may receive you into everlasting habitations."
(Luke xvi. 9.) "In the world to come, life <i>everlasting</i>."
(Luke xviii. 30.) "He that believeth on the Son
hath <i>everlasting</i> life." (Jno. iii. 15, 16, 36; v. 24.) "The
commandment of the <i>everlasting</i> God." (Rom. xvi. 26.)
"An exceeding and <i>eternal</i> weight of glory." (2 Cor. iv. 17.)
"The things which are not seen are <i>eternal</i>." (<i>v.</i> 18.)
"A house not made with hands, <i>eternal</i> in the heavens."
(Chap. v. 1.) "They shall be punished with <i>everlasting</i>
destruction." (2 Thess. i. 9.) "Hath given us <i>everlasting</i>
consolation." (Chap. ii. 16.) "In Christ Jesus with <i>eternal</i>
glory." (2 Tim. ii. 10.) "The author of <i>eternal</i> salvation."
(Heb. v. 9.) "Having obtained <i>eternal</i> redemption." (Chap.
ix. 12.) "Who through the <i>eternal</i> Spirit offered Himself
without spot to God." (v. 14.) "The promise of <i>eternal</i>
inheritance." (v. 15.) "Called us unto His <i>eternal</i> glory."
(1 Pet. v. 10.) "Into the <i>everlasting</i> kingdom of our Lord
and Saviour." (2 Pet. i. 11.) "This is the true God and
<i>eternal</i> life." (1 Jno. v. 20.) "Suffering the vengeance of
<i>eternal</i> fire." (Jude 7.)</p>

<p>Now, we are aware that the opposers of the doctrine of
eternal punishment endeavor to prove that the word "everlasting"
does not mean everlasting in the Greek; and this
is one reason why we have quoted such a number of passages
in which the Greek word &#945;&#953;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962; (<i>aionios</i>) occurs,
and in which the Holy Ghost applies it in such a variety
of ways. The word which is applied to the punishment of
the wicked is also applied to the life which believers possess,
to the salvation and redemption in which they rejoice,
to the glory to which they look forward, to those mansions
in which they hope to dwell, and to the inheritance which
they expect to enjoy. Moreover, it is applied to God, and
to the Spirit. If, therefore, it be maintained that the word
"everlasting" does not mean everlasting when applied to
the punishment of the wicked, what security have we that
it means everlasting when applied to the life, blessedness,
and glory of the redeemed? What warrant has any one,
be he ever so learned, to single out seven instances from
the seventy in which the Greek word &#945;&#953;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962; is used, and
say that in those seven it does not mean everlasting, but
that in all the rest it does? They have none whatever.
Men may reason as they will about divine benevolence
and goodness&mdash;about its being inconsistent with the mercy
of God to permit such a thing as eternal punishment&mdash;as
to the strange want of proportion between a few years of
sin and an endless eternity of punishment; a single line
of holy Scripture is amply sufficient, in our judgment, to
sweep away ten thousand such reasonings, even though
supported by the learned dogma that "everlasting" does
not mean everlasting in the Greek. "Where their worm
dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." (Mark ix. 46.)
Solemn statement! Let men beware of trifling with it, or
reasoning about it. Let them believe it, and flee from the
wrath to come&mdash;flee now to Jesus, who died on Calvary's
cursed tree to deliver us from everlasting burnings.</p>

<p>But not only is the eternity of punishment clearly laid
down in Scripture&mdash;as clearly as the eternity of God Himself,
or of any thing pertaining to Him; we believe it also
flows as a necessary truth from other truths which are
generally received without a single question. Take, for
instance, the immortality of the soul. Did the fall of man
touch this question? We believe not. Man was made
the possessor of an immortal spirit, by the breath of the
Almighty; and we have no authority whatsoever to say
that his fall made any difference as to this. Immortal he
was, as to his soul, immortal he is, and immortal he must
be. Yes, he must live forever somewhere. Tremendous
thought! Many do not like it. They would fain be able
to say, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die."
They would like to pass away as the beasts that perish;
and this very desire, we doubt not, has been, in many
cases, the parent of the notion that punishment is non-eternal.
"The wish is father to the thought." But, ah!
man must face that dreadful reality, <i><span class="smcap">Eternity</span></i>. Saved
or unsaved, there is no escaping that. He must either
deny the immortality of the soul, or admit the eternity
of punishment.</p>

<p>Again, take the doctrine of the atonement. If any thing
less than eternal punishment be due to sin, what need
was there of an infinite sacrifice to give deliverance from
that punishment? Could nothing less than the peerless,
priceless, divine sacrifice of the Son of God deliver any
one from hell fire, and that fire not be eternal? Did Jesus
shed His precious blood to deliver us from the consequences
of our guilt, and those consequences be only
temporary? We can never admit any such proposition.
Grant us the truth of an infinite sacrifice, and we argue
from thence the truth of eternal punishment.</p>

<p>We attach no weight whatever to the argument drawn
from the lack of proportion between a few years of sin
and an eternity of woe. We do not believe that this is
the true way to measure the matter. The cross is the
only measure by which to reach a true result; and we
believe the deniers of eternal punishment offer dishonor
to the cross by lowering it into a means of deliverance
from a doom which is not eternal in its duration.</p>

<p>And now, one word as to the idea of its being incompatible
with the character of God to allow such a thing as
eternal punishment. Many seem to attach great weight
to this. They appear to think that eternal misery could
never comport with divine mercy and goodness. But those
who urge this plea seem to forget that there is another
side of the question, which must be looked at if we would
reach a sound conclusion on the point. What about divine
justice, holiness, and truth? Are these things not to be
taken into account? Can we base an argument on some
of the divine attributes and leave others out? Surely not.
We must look at them all. The cross of Christ has harmonized
them all, in the view of all created intelligences.
In that cross, God has set forth His perfect love to the
sinner; but He also has set forth His perfect hatred of sin.
Now, if a man deliberately rejects that only way of escape&mdash;that
perfect remedy&mdash;that divine provision, what is to
be done? God cannot let sin into His presence. He is
of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on
iniquity. Will the deniers of eternal punishment tell us
what is to be done? How is this question to be settled?
They say, by annihilation,&mdash;that is, by man's perishing
like a beast. Ah, this will never do! "The Lord God
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became
a living soul." (Gen. ii. 7.) Was this ever revoked?
Is there a shadow of foundation in the entire book of God
for the theory of annihilation? If there is, let it be produced.
We look upon it as a most miserable subterfuge&mdash;a
pitiable attempt to get rid of the awful thought of
eternity. But it will not do. Let man but cast his eye
on the page of inspiration, and there he sees that tremendous
word, "<span class="smcap">Eternity</span>"! "<span class="smcap">Eternity</span>"! "<span class="smcap">Eternity</span>"!
Let him but lend his ear to the voice that issues from the
depth of his moral being, and he will hear the same soul-subduing
word, "Eternity"! "Eternity"! "Eternity"!
He cannot get rid of it; he cannot shake it off. He is
shut up to the stern fact that he must live forever.</p>

<p>Well, then, what about his sin? That cannot get into
God's presence. God and sin can never be together. This
is a fixed principle. God is good, no doubt, and the proof
of His goodness is the gift of His Son. But then He is
holy; and between holiness and sin there must be an eternal
separation; so that we are forced to the same solemn
conclusion, namely, that all who die in their sins&mdash;all
who die in the rejection of God's infinite provision for the
forgiveness of sins, will have to endure the consequences
of those sins in the lake that burneth with fire and
brimstone throughout the countless ages of eternity.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>We will not argue the matter further in this paper; but
we would most earnestly beseech the unconverted reader
to pause and seriously consider this most momentous
question. Let him not be deceived by vain words; let
him not hearken to a false criticism, which would fain
persuade him that "eternal" does not mean eternal in
the Greek; for, oh, most assuredly, it does mean eternal,
whether in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or English. "Eternal"
can never mean temporal, or "temporal" eternal, in any
language under heaven. And furthermore, let him not
hearken to a false sentimentality, which would fain persuade
him that God is too kind to consign any of His
creatures to hell fire. God was so kind as to "give His
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him
might not perish, but have everlasting life." But God is
too holy to let sin into heaven; and hence, instead of
feeding himself with the vain hope (if hope it can be
called,) of annihilation, let him build upon the sure Word
of God, which tells him of full, free, and everlasting salvation
through the blood of the Lamb. Our God has no
pleasure in the death of a sinner. His long-suffering is
salvation, not willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance. There is no reason why the
reader should perish. God waits to be gracious. Mercy's
door stands wide open, and the sword of judgment is in
the scabbard. But the moment is rapidly approaching
when all shall be changed, and then all who die in their
sins will prove, by bitter experience, that, notwithstanding
all the arguments founded upon a false criticism and
a false sentimentality, <i>the punishment of sin is and must
be eternal</i>.</p>

<h2>PAPERS ON THE LORD'S COMING</h2>


<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p>The attentive reader of the New Testament will find in
its pages three solemn and weighty facts presented to his
view; namely, first, That the Son of God has come into
this world and gone away; secondly, That the Holy
Ghost has come down to this earth, and is here still; and,
thirdly, That the Lord Jesus is coming again.</p>

<p>These are the three great subjects unfolded in the New
Testament Scriptures; and we shall find that each of them
has a double bearing: it has a bearing upon the world
and a bearing upon the church; upon the world, as a
whole, and upon each unconverted man, woman and
child in particular; upon the church, as a whole, and
upon each individual member thereof, in particular. It
is impossible for any one to avoid the bearing of these
three grand facts upon his own personal condition and
future destiny.</p>

<p>And, be it noted, we are not speaking of doctrines&mdash;though,
no doubt, there are doctrines&mdash;but of facts&mdash;facts
presented in the simplest possible manner by the
various inspired writers employed to set them forth.
There is no attempt at garnishing or setting off. The
facts speak for themselves; they are recorded and left to
produce their own powerful effect upon the soul.</p>

<p>I. And, first of all, let us look at the fact that the Son
of God has been in this world of ours. "God so loved
the world that he gave his only begotten Son." "The
Son of God has come." He came in perfect love, as the
very expression of the heart and mind, the nature and
character of God. He was the brightness of God's glory,
and the express image of His person, and yet a lowly,
humble, gracious, social man; one who was to be seen,
from day to day, about the streets; going from house to
house; kind and affable to all; easily approached by the
very poorest; taking up little children in His arms, in the
most tender, gentle, winning way; drying the widow's
tears; soothing the stricken and sorrowing heart; feeding
the hungry, healing the sick; cleansing the poor
leper; meeting every form of human need and misery;
at the bidding of all who stood in need of succor and
sympathy. "He went about doing good." He was the
unwearied servant of man's necessities. He never thought
of Himself, or sought His own interest in any one thing.
He lived for others. It was His meat and His drink to
do the will of God, and gladden the sad and weary hearts
of the sons and daughters of men. His loving heart was
ever flowing out in streams of blessing to all who felt the
pressure of this sin-stricken, sorrowful world.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a marvellous fact before our eyes.
This world has been visited&mdash;this world has been trodden
by that blessed One of whom we have spoken&mdash;the Son
of God&mdash;the Creator and Sustainer of the universe&mdash;the
lowly, self-emptied and loving, gracious Son of Man&mdash;Jesus
of Nazareth&mdash;God over all blessed for ever, and yet
a spotless, holy, absolutely perfect man. He came in love
to men&mdash;came into this world as the expression of perfect
love to those who had sinned against God, and deserved
nothing but eternal perdition because of their sins. He
came not to crush, but to heal&mdash;not to judge, but to save
and to bless.</p>

<p>What has become of this blessed One? How has the
world treated Him? It has cast Him out! It would not
have Him! It preferred a robber and a murderer to this
holy, gracious, perfect Man. The world got its choice.
Jesus and a robber were placed before the world, and the
question was put, "Which will you have?" What was
the answer? "Not this man, but Barabbas." "The
chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they
should ask Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor
answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will
ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas"
(Matt. xxvii. 20, 21). The religious leaders and guides of
the people&mdash;the men who ought to have led them in the
right way&mdash;persuaded the poor ignorant multitude to reject
the Son of God, and accept a robber and a murderer
instead!</p>

<p>Reader, remember, you are in a world that has been
guilty of this terrible act. And not only so, but, unless
you have truly repented and believed on the Lord Jesus
Christ, you are part and parcel of that world, and you lie
under the full guilt of that act. This is most solemn.
The whole world stands charged with the deliberate rejection
and murder of the Son of God. We have the testimony
of no less than four inspired witnesses to this fact.
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John all bear record that the
whole world&mdash;the Jew and the Gentile&mdash;kings and governors,
priests and people&mdash;all classes, sects and parties,
agreed to crucify the Son of God&mdash;all agreed to murder
the only perfect man that ever appeared on this earth&mdash;the
perfect expression of God&mdash;God over all blessed for
ever. We must either pronounce the four evangelists to
be false witnesses, or admit that the world as a whole, and
each constituent part thereof, is stained with the awful
crime of crucifying the Lord of glory.</p>

<p>This is the true standard by which to measure the
world, and by which to measure the condition of every
unconverted man, woman and child in the world. If I
want to know what the world is I have only to reflect
that the world is that which stands charged before God
with the deliberate murder of His Son. Tremendous
fact! A fact which stamps the world, in the most solemn
manner, and places it before us in characters of appalling
blackness. God has a controversy with this world. He
has a question to settle with it&mdash;an awful question&mdash;the
mere mention of which should make men's ears to tingle
and their hearts to quake. A righteous God has to
avenge the death of His Son. It is not merely that the
world accepted a vile robber and murdered an innocent
man; this, in itself, would have been a dreadful act.
But no; that innocent man was none other than the Son
of God, the beloved of the Father's heart.</p>

<p>What a thought! The world will have to account to
God for the death of His Son&mdash;for having nailed Him to
a cross between two thieves! What a reckoning it will
be! How red will be the day of vengeance! How awfully
crushing the moment in the which God will draw the
sword of judgment to avenge the death of His Son! How
utterly vain the notion that the world is improving! Improving!&mdash;though
stained with the blood of Jesus. Improving!&mdash;though
under the judgment of God for that
act. Improving!&mdash;though having to account to a righteous
God for its treatment of the beloved of His soul,
sent in love to bless and save. What blind fatuity! What
wild folly! Ah, no! reader, improvement there can be
none till the besom of destruction and the sword of judgment
have done their terrible work in avenging the murder&mdash;the
deliberately planned and determinedly executed
murder of the blessed Son of God. We cannot conceive
any delusion more fatally false than to imagine that the
world can ever be improved while it lies beneath the
awful curse of the death of Jesus. That world which
preferred Barabbas to Christ can know no improvement.
There is naught before it save the overwhelming judgment
of God.</p>

<p>Thus much as to the weighty fact of the absence of
Jesus, in its bearing upon the present condition and
future destiny of the world. But this fact has another
bearing. It bears upon the church of God as a whole,
and upon the individual believer. If the world has cast
Christ out, the heavens have received Him. If man has
rejected Him, God has exalted Him. If man has crucified
Him, God has crowned Him. We must carefully distinguish
these two things. The death of Christ, viewed as
the act of the world&mdash;the act of man&mdash;involves naught
but unmitigated wrath and judgment. On the other
hand, the death of Christ, viewed as the act of God,
involves naught but full and everlasting blessedness to all
who repent and believe. A passage or two from the
divine word will prove this.</p>

<p>Let us turn for a moment to Psalm lxix., which so vividly
presents our blessed and adorable Lord suffering
from the hand of man, and appealing to God for vengeance.
"Hear me, O Lord; for thy loving kindness is
good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy
tender mercies. And hide not thy face from thy servant;
for I am in trouble: hear me speedily: draw nigh unto
my soul, and redeem it: deliver me, because of mine
enemies. Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame,
and my dishonor: <i>mine adversaries are all before thee</i>.
Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness:
and I looked for some to take pity, but there was
none; and for comforters, but I found none. They gave
me also gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me
vinegar to drink. Let their table become a snare before
them: and that which should have been for their welfare,
let it become a trap. Let their eyes be darkened, that
they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful
anger take hold of them," etc. (verses 16-28).</p>

<p>All this is deeply and impressively solemn. Every
word of this appeal will have its answer. Not a syllable
of it shall fall to the ground. God will assuredly avenge
the death of His Son. He will reckon with the world&mdash;with
men for the treatment which His only begotten Son
has received at their hands. We deem it right to press
this home upon the heart and conscience of the reader.
How awful the thought of Christ making intercession
<i>against</i> people! How appalling to hear Him calling upon
God for vengeance upon His enemies! How terrible will
be the divine response to the cry of the injured Son!</p>

<p>But let us look at the other side of the picture. Turn
to Psalm xxii., which presents the blessed One suffering
under the hand of God. Here the result is wholly different.
Instead of judgment and vengeance, it is universal
and everlasting blessedness and glory. "I will
declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the
congregation will I praise thee. Ye that fear the Lord,
praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and
fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.... My praise
shall be of thee in the great congregation; I will pay my
vows before them that fear him. The meek shall eat and
be satisfied; they shall praise the Lord that seek him;
your heart shall live for ever. All the ends of the world
shall remember and turn unto the Lord; and all the
kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. For
the kingdom is the Lord's; and he is the governor among
the nations.... A seed shall serve him; it shall be
accounted to the Lord for a generation. They shall
come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people
that shall be born, that he hath done this" (verses 22-31).</p>

<p>These two quotations present, with great distinctness,
the two aspects of the death of Christ. He died, as a
martyr, for righteousness, under the hand of man. For
this, man will have to account to God. But He died, as a
victim, for sin, under the hand of God. This is the
foundation of all blessing to those that believe in His
name. His martyr-sufferings bring down wrath and
judgment upon a godless world: His atoning sufferings
open up the everlasting well-springs of life and salvation
to the church, to Israel, and to the whole creation. The
death of Jesus consummates the world's guilt; but secures
the church's acceptance. The world is <i>stained</i>, and
the church <i>purged</i>, by the blood of the cross.</p>

<p>Such is the double bearing of the first of our three
great New Testament facts. Jesus has come and gone&mdash;come,
because God loved the world&mdash;gone, because the
world hated God. If God were to ask the question&mdash;and
He will ask it&mdash;"What have you done with my
Son?" What is the answer? "We hated Him, cast
Him out, and crucified Him. We preferred a robber to
Him."</p>

<p>But, blessed for ever be the God of all grace, the Christian,
the true believer, can look up to heaven and say,
"My absent Lord is there, and there for me. He is gone
from this wretched world, and His absence makes the
entire scene around me a moral wilderness&mdash;a desolate
waste."</p>

<p><i>He is not here.</i> This stamps the world with a character
unmistakable in the judgment of every loyal heart. The
world would not have Jesus. This is enough. We need
not marvel at any tale of horror now. Police reports,
grand jury calendars, the statistics of our cities and towns
need not surprise us. The world that could reject the
divine personification of all human goodness, and accept
a robber and a murderer instead, has proved its moral turpitude
to a degree not to be exceeded. Do we wonder
when we discover the hollowness and heartlessness of the
world? Are we surprised when we find out that it is not
to be trusted? If so, it is plain we have not interpreted
aright the absence of our beloved Lord. What does the
cross of Christ prove? That God is love? No doubt.
That Christ gave His precious life to save us from the
flames of an everlasting hell? Blessedly true, all praise
to His peerless name! But what does the cross prove as
regards the world? That its guilt is consummated, and
its judgment sealed. The world, in nailing to the cross
the One who was perfectly good, proved, in the most unanswerable
manner, that it was perfectly bad. "If I had
not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:
but now they have no cloak for their sin. He that hateth
me hateth my Father also. If I had not done among
them the works which none other man did, they had not
had sin; but now have they both seen and hated both
me and my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the
word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They
hated me without a cause" (John xv. 22-26).</p>

<p>II. But we must now glance for a moment at our second
weighty fact. God the Holy Ghost has come down
to this earth. It is now over eighteen long centuries
since the blessed Spirit descended from heaven; and He
has been here ever since. This is a stupendous fact.
There is a divine Person on this earth; and His presence&mdash;like
the absence of Jesus&mdash;has a double bearing: it has
a bearing upon the world, and a bearing upon the church&mdash;upon
the world as a whole, and upon every man, woman
and child therein; upon the church as a whole, and
upon every individual member thereof in particular. As
regards the world, this august witness descended from
heaven to convict it of the terrible crime of rejecting and
crucifying the Son of God. As regards the church, He
came as the blessed Comforter, to take the place of the
absent Jesus, and comfort by His presence and ministry
the hearts of His people. Thus, to the world, the Holy
Ghost is a powerful <i>Convicter</i>; to the church he is a
precious <i>Comforter</i>.</p>

<p>A passage or two of holy Scripture will establish these
points in the heart and mind of the pious reader who
bows in lowly reverence to the authority of the divine
word. Let us turn to chapter xvi. of John's Gospel.
"But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none
of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But because I
have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your
heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient
for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter
will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will
send him unto you. And when he is come, he will <i>convict</i>
(&#949;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#958;&#949;&#953;) the world of sin, and of righteousness, and
of judgment. Of sin, because they believe not on me;
of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see
me no more; of judgment, because the prince of this
world is judged" (verses 5-11).</p>

<p>Again in John xiv. we read, "If ye love me, keep my
commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he
shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide
with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the
world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither
knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with
you, and shall be in you" (verses 15-19).</p>

<p>These quotations prove the double bearing of the presence
of the Holy Ghost. We cannot attempt to dwell
upon this subject in this brief introduction; but we trust
the reader may be led to study it for himself, in the light
of holy Scripture; and we are persuaded that the more he
thus studies it, the more deeply he will feel its interest
and immense practical importance. Alas! that it should
be so little understood; that Christians should so little
see what is involved in the personal presence of the
eternal Spirit, God the Holy Ghost, on this earth&mdash;its
solemn consequences as regards the world, and its precious
results as regards the assembly as a whole, and each
individual member in particular.</p>

<p>Oh! that God's people everywhere may be led into a
deeper understanding of these things; that they may
consider what is due to that divine Person who dwells in
them and with them; that they may have a jealous care
not to "grieve" Him in their private walk, or "quench"
Him in their public assemblies!</p>

<p>We shall, if God permit, enter, in our next paper, upon
the third fact, which is the immediate subject of the
series of papers which we propose to write, namely: The
coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. May God
the Spirit open this most glorious subject in living power
and freshness to our souls, so that we may, in truth and
reality, be waiting for God's Son from heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13k" id="Page_13k">&nbsp;</a></span></p>
<h3>THE FACT ITSELF</h3>

<p>In approaching this most glorious subject, we feel that
we cannot do better than to lay before the reader the distinct
testimony of holy Scripture to the broad fact itself,
that our Lord Jesus Christ will come again&mdash;that He will
leave the place which He now occupies on His Father's
throne, and come in the clouds of heaven, to receive His
people to Himself; to execute judgment upon the
wicked; and set up His own everlasting and universal
kingdom.</p>

<p>This fact is as clearly and fully set forth in the New
Testament as either of the other two facts to which we
have already referred. It is as true that the Son of God
is coming from heaven, as that He is gone to heaven, or
that the Holy Ghost is still on this earth. If we admit
one fact, we must admit all: and if we deny one, we
must deny all; inasmuch as all rest upon precisely the
same authority. They stand or fall together. Is it true
that the Son of God was refused, cast out, crucified? Is
it true that He has gone away into heaven? Is it true
that He is now seated at the right hand of God, crowned
with glory and honor? Is it true that God the Holy
Ghost came down to this earth, fifty days after the resurrection
of our Lord; and that He is still here?</p>

<p>Are these things true? As true as Scripture can make
them. Then just as true is it that our blessed Lord will
come again, and set up His kingdom upon this earth&mdash;that
He will literally, and actually, and personally come
from heaven, take to Himself His great power and reign
from pole to pole, and from the river to the ends of the
earth.</p>

<p>It may perhaps seem strange to some of our readers
that we should deem it needful to undertake the proof of
such a plain truth as this; but be it remembered that we
are writing on this subject as though it were perfectly
new to the reader; as if he had never heard of such a
thing as the Lord's second coming; or as if, having
heard of it, he still calls it in question. This must be our
apology for handling this precious theme in so elementary
a manner.</p>

<p>Now for our proofs.</p>

<p>When our adorable Lord was about to take leave of
His disciples, He sought, in His infinite grace, to comfort
their sorrowing hearts by words of sweetest tenderness.
"Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe
also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions;
if it were not so I would have told you. I go to
prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place
for you, <i>I will come again</i>, and receive you unto myself;
that where I am, there ye may be also" (John xiv. 1-3).</p>

<p>Here we may have something most definite. Indeed it
is as definite as it is cheering and consolatory. "I will
come again." He does not say, I will send for you.
Still less does He say, "You will come to me when you
die." He says nothing of the kind. To send an angel,
or a legion of angels, would not be the same thing as
coming Himself. No doubt it would be very gracious of
Him, and very glorious for us, if a multitude of the
heavenly host were sent, with horses of fire and chariots
of fire, to convey us triumphantly to heaven. But it
would not be the fulfilment of His own sweet promise.
And most surely He will do what He promised to do.
He will not say one thing and do another. He cannot
lie or alter His word. And not only this, but it would
not satisfy the love of His heart to send an angel or a host
of angels to fetch us. He will come Himself.</p>

<p>What touching grace shines in all this! If I am expecting
a very dear and valued friend by train, I shall
not be satisfied with sending a servant or an empty cab
to meet him; I shall go myself. This is precisely what
our loving Lord means to do. He is gone to heaven;
and His entrance there prepares and defines His people's
place. Amid the many mansions of the Father's house,
there would be no place for us if our Jesus had not gone
before; and then, lest there should be in the heart any
feeling of strangeness at the thought of our entrance into
that place, He says, with such sweetness, "I will come
again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am
there ye may be also." Nothing short of this can fulfil
the gracious promise of our Lord, or satisfy the love of
His heart.</p>

<p>And be it carefully noted that this promise has no
reference whatever to the death of the individual believer.
Who can imagine that, when our Lord said, "I
will come again," He really meant that we should go to
Him through death? How can we presume to take such
liberties with the plain and precious words of our Lord?
Surely if He meant to speak of our going to Him, through
death, He could and would have said so. But He has not
said so, because He did not mean so; nor is it possible
that He could say one thing and mean another. His
coming for us, and our going to Him, are totally different
things; and being different ideas, they would have been
clothed in different language.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, in the case of the penitent thief on
the cross, our Lord does not speak of coming to fetch
him; but He says, "To-day shalt thou be with me in
paradise." We really must remember that Scripture is
as divinely definite as it is divinely inspired, and hence
it never could and it never does confound two things so
totally different as the Lord's coming and the Christian's
falling asleep.</p>

<p>It may be well, at this point, to remark that there are
but four passages in the entire New Testament in which
allusion is made to the subject of the Christian passing
through the article of death. The first is that passage in
Luke xxiii. already referred to: "To-day shalt thou be
with me in paradise." The second occurs in Acts vii.,
"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." The third is that most
familiar and lovely utterance in 2 Corinthians v., "Absent
from the body, present with the Lord." The fourth
occurs in that charming first of Philippians, "Having a
desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far
better."</p>

<p>These most precious passages make up the sum of
Scripture testimony on the interesting question of the
disembodied state. There is a passage in Revelation xiv.
often misapplied to this subject: "Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord <i>from henceforth</i>: Yea, saith the
Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their
works do follow them." But this has no application to
Christians now, though no doubt all such who die in the
Lord are blessed, and their works do follow them. The
reference, however, is to a time yet future, when the
church shall have left this scene altogether, and other witnesses
make their appearance. In a word, Revelation
xiv. 13 bears upon apocalyptic times, and must be so
viewed if we would avoid confusion.</p>

<p>We must now resume our subject, and proceed with
our proofs, and in so doing we shall ask the reader to
turn to the first chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. The
blessed Lord had just gone up from this earth, in the
presence of His holy apostles. "And while they looked
steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two
men stood by him in white apparel; which also said, Ye
men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into
heaven" (verses 10, 11).</p>

<p>This is intensely interesting, and furnishes a most
striking proof of our present thesis. Indeed it is impossible
to avoid its force. Alas! that any should seek or
desire to avoid it! From the manner in which the
angelic witnesses speak to the men of Galilee it would
seem like tautology; but, as we well know, there is&mdash;there
can be&mdash;no such thing in the volume of God. It
is, therefore, lovely fulness, divine completeness, that we
see in this testimony. From it we learn that the self-same
Jesus who left this earth, and ascended into heaven,
in the presence of a number of witnesses, shall <i>so</i> come
<i>in like manner as</i> they had seen Him go into heaven.
How did He go? He went up personally, literally, actually,
the very same person who had just been conversing
familiarly with them&mdash;whom they had seen with
their eyes, heard with their ears, handled with their
hands&mdash;who had eaten in their presence, and "showed
himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs."
Well then, "He shall so come in like manner."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He who with hands uplifted,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Went from this earth below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall come again all gifted,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His blessing to bestow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And here we may ask&mdash;though it be rather anticipating
what may come before us in a future paper&mdash;Who saw
the blessed Lord as He went up? Did the world? Nay;
not one unconverted, unbelieving person ever laid his
eyes upon our precious Lord from the moment that He
was laid in the tomb. The last sight the world got of
Jesus was as He hung on the cross, a spectacle to angels,
men, and devils. The next sight they will get of Him
will be when, like the lightning flash, He shall come
forth to execute judgment, and tread, in terrible vengeance,
the winepress of the wrath of Almighty God.
Tremendous thought!</p>

<p>None, therefore, but His own saw the ascending Saviour,
as none but they had seen Him from the moment
of His resurrection. He showed Himself, blessed be His
holy name! to those who were dear to His heart. He
assured and comforted, strengthened and encouraged
their souls by these "many infallible proofs" of which
the inspired narrator speaks to us. He led them to the
very confines of the unseen world, just so far as men
could go while still in the body; and there He allowed
them to see Him ascending into heaven; and while they
gazed upon this glorious sight He sent the precious testimony
home to their very hearts. "This same Jesus"&mdash;no
other, no stranger, but the same loving, sympathizing,
gracious, unchanging friend&mdash;"whom ye have seen go
into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen
him go into heaven."</p>

<p>Is it possible for testimony to be more distinct or satisfactory?
Could proof be more clear or conclusive? How
can any counter argument stand for a moment, or any
objection be raised? Either those two men in white apparel
were false witnesses, or our Jesus shall come again
in the exact manner in which He went away. There is
no middle ground between those two conclusions. We
read in Scripture that, "in the mouth of two or three
witnesses shall every word be established;" and therefore
in the mouth of two heavenly messengers&mdash;two heralds
from the region of light and truth, we have the word
established that our Lord Jesus Christ shall come again
in actual bodily form, to be seen by His own first of all,
apart from all others, in the holy intimacy and profound
retirement which characterized His departure from this
world. All this, blessed be God, is wrapped up in the
two little words "<i>as</i>" and "<i>so</i>."</p>

<p>We cannot attempt, in a brief paper like the present, to
adduce all the proofs which are to be found in the pages
of the New Testament. We have given one from the
Gospels and one from the Acts, and we shall now ask the
reader to turn with us to the Epistles. Let us take, for
example, the First Epistle to the Thessalonians. We
select this epistle because it is acknowledged to have been
the earliest of Paul's writings; and further, because it
was written to a company of very young converts. This
latter point is valuable, inasmuch as we sometimes hear it
stated that the truth of the Lord's coming is not suitable
to bring before the minds of young believers. That the
Apostle Paul did not think it unsuitable is evident from
the fact that of all the epistles which he wrote not one
contains so much about the Lord's coming as that which
he penned for the newly converted Thessalonians. The
fact is, when a soul is converted and brought into the full
light and liberty of the gospel of Christ, it becomes
divinely natural for such a one to look for the Lord's
coming. That most precious truth is an integral part of
the gospel. The first coming and the second coming are
most blessedly bound up together by the divine link of
the personal presence of the Holy Ghost in the church.</p>

<p>On the other hand, where the soul is not established
in grace; where peace and liberty are not enjoyed;
where a defective gospel has been received, there it will
be found that the hope of the Lord's coming will not be
cherished, for the simple reason that the soul is, of necessity,
occupied with the question of its own state and
prospects. If I am not certain of my salvation&mdash;if I do
not know that I have eternal life&mdash;that I am a child of
God&mdash;I cannot be looking out for the Lord's return. It
is only when we know what Jesus has done for us at His
first coming that we can with bright and holy intelligence
look out for His second coming.</p>

<p>But let us turn to our epistle. Take the following
sentences from the first chapter: "For our gospel came
not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the
Holy Ghost, and in much assurance.... So that ye
were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
Achaia. For from you sounded out the word of the
Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in
every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so
that we need not to speak anything. For they themselves
show of us what manner of entering in we had
unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve
the living and true God; and <i>to wait for his Son from
heaven</i>, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which
delivered us from the wrath to come" (verses 5-10).</p>

<p>Here we have a fine illustration of the effect of a full
clear gospel, received in simple earnest faith. They
turned from idols, to serve the living and true God, and
to wait for His Son. They were actually converted to
the blessed hope of the Lord's coming. It was an integral
part of the gospel which Paul preached; and an integral
part of their faith. Was it a reality to turn from idols?
Doubtless. Was it a reality to serve the living God?
Unquestionably. Well then it was just as real, just as
positive, just as simple, their waiting for God's Son from
heaven. If we question the reality of one, we must question
the reality of all, inasmuch as all are bound up together
and form a beauteous cluster of practical Christian
truth. If you had asked a Thessalonian Christian what
he was waiting for, what would have been his reply?
Would he have said, "I am waiting for the world to improve
by means of the gospel which I myself have received?
or, I am waiting for the moment of my death
when I shall go to be with Jesus?" No. His reply
would have been simply this, "I am waiting for the Son
of God from heaven." This, and nothing else, is the
proper hope of the Christian, the proper hope of the
church. To wait for the improvement of the world is not
Christian hope at all. You might as well wait for the
improvement of the flesh, for there is just as much hope
of the one as the other. And as to the article of death&mdash;though
no doubt it may intervene&mdash;it is never once presented
as the true and proper hope of the Christian. It
may, with the fullest confidence, be asserted that there is
not so much as a single passage in the entire New Testament
in which death is spoken of as the hope of the believer;
whereas, on the other hand, the hope of the
Lord's coming is bound up, in the most intimate manner,
with all the concerns and associations and relationships
of life, as we may see in the epistle before us. Thus, if
the apostle would refer to the interesting question of his
own personal connection with the beloved saints at Thessalonica,
he says, "For what is our hope, or joy, or
crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of
our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? For ye are our
glory and joy."</p>

<p>Again, if he thinks of their progress in holiness and
love, he adds, "And the Lord make you to increase and
abound in love one toward another, and toward all men,
even as we do toward you; to the end he may stablish
your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our
Father, <i>at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</i> with all his
saints" (chap. iii. 12, 13).</p>

<p>Finally, if the apostle would seek to comfort the hearts
of his brethren in reference to those who had fallen
asleep, how does he do it? Does he tell them that they
should soon follow them? Nay; this would have been
in full keeping with Old Testament times, as David says
of his departed child, "I shall go to him, but he shall
not return to me" (2 Sam. xii. 23). But it is not thus
that the Holy Ghost instructs us in 1 Thessalonians&mdash;quite
the reverse. "I would not," he says, "have you
to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are
asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no
hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring
with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the
Lord, that [not they which shall be, but] <i>we</i> which <i>are</i>
alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not
prevent [come before or take precedence of] them which
are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from
heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and
with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise
first. Then <i>we</i> which are alive and remain shall be caught
up together with them in clouds, to meet the Lord in
the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore
comfort one another with these words" (chap. iv.
13-18).</p>

<p>It is impossible for any proof to be more simple, direct,
and conclusive than this. The Thessalonian Christians,
as we have already remarked, were converted to the hope
of the Lord's return. They were taught to look out for
it daily. It was as much a part of their Christianity to
believe that He <i>would</i> come, as to believe that He <i>had</i>
come and gone. Hence it came to pass that when some
of their number were called to pass through death, they
were taken aback; they had not anticipated this; and
they feared lest the departed should miss the joy of that
blissful and longed-for moment of the Lord's return.
The apostle therefore writes to correct their mistake;
and, in so doing, he pours a fresh flood of light upon the
whole subject, and assures them that the dead in Christ&mdash;which
includes all who had or shall have fallen asleep;
in short, those of Old Testament times as well as those of
the New&mdash;should rise first, that is, before the living are
changed, and all shall ascend together to meet their descending
Lord.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion to refer to this remarkable passage
again, when handling other branches of this glorious
subject. We merely quote it here as one of the almost
innumerable proofs of the fact that our Lord will come
again, personally, really, and actually; and that His personal
coming is the true and proper hope of the church
of God collectively, and of the believer individually.</p>

<p>We shall close this paper by reminding the Christian
reader that he can never sit down to the table of his
Lord without being reminded of this glorious hope, so
long as those words shine on the page of inspiration,
"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye
do show the Lord's death till"&mdash;when? Till ye die?
Nay; but&mdash;"<i>till he come</i>" (1 Cor. xi. 26). How precious
is this! The table of the Lord stands between those two
marvellous epochs, the cross and the advent&mdash;the death
and the glory. The believer can look up from the table
and see the beams of the glory gilding the horizon. It is
our privilege, as we gather, on each Lord's day, round
the Lord's table, to show forth the Lord's death, to be
able to say, "This may be the last occasion of celebrating
this precious feast; ere another Lord's day dawn upon us,
He Himself may come." Again we say, How precious is
this!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23k" id="Page_23k">&nbsp;</a></span></p>
<h3>THE DOUBLE BEARING OF THE FACT</h3>

<p>Having, as we trust, fully established, in our last paper,
the fact of the Lord's coming, we have now to place before
the reader the double bearing of that fact&mdash;its bearing
upon the Lord's people, and its bearing upon the
world. The former is presented, in the New Testament,
as the coming of Christ to receive His people to Himself;
the latter is spoken of as "The day of the Lord"&mdash;a term
of frequent use also in Old Testament Scriptures.</p>

<p>These things are never confounded in Scripture, as we
shall see when we come to look at the various passages.
Christians do confound them, and hence it is that we
often find "that blessed hope" overcast with heavy
clouds, and associated in the mind with circumstances of
terror, wrath, and judgment, which have nothing whatever
to do with the <i>coming</i> of Christ for His people, but
are intimately bound up with "The <i>day</i> of the Lord."</p>

<p>Let the Christian reader, then, have it settled in his
heart, on the clear authority of holy Scripture, that the
grand and specific hope for him ever to cherish is the
coming of Christ for His people. This hope may be
realized this very night. There is nothing whatever to
wait for&mdash;no events to transpire amongst the nations&mdash;nothing
to occur in the history of Israel&mdash;nothing in God's
government of the world&mdash;nothing, in short, in any shape
or form whatsoever, to intervene between the heart of
the true believer and his heavenly hope. Christ may
come for His people to-night. There is actually nothing
to hinder. No one can tell when He <i>will</i> come; but we
can joyfully say that, at any moment, He <i>may</i> come.
And, blessed be His name, when He does come for us, it
will not be with the accompanying circumstances of
terror, wrath, and judgment. It will not be with blackness
and darkness and tempest. These things will accompany
"the day of the Lord," as the Apostle Peter
plainly tells the Jews in his first great sermon, on the
day of Pentecost, in which he quotes the following words
from the solemn prophecy of Joel, "And I will show
wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath;
blood and fire and vapor of smoke: the sun shall be
turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before"&mdash;what?
the coming of the Lord for His people? Nay;
but before "<i>that great and notable day of the Lord</i> come."</p>

<p>When our Lord shall come to receive His people to
Himself no eye shall see Him, no ear shall hear His
voice, save His own redeemed and beloved people. Let
us remember the words of the angelic witnesses in the
first of Acts. Who saw the blessed One ascending into
the heavens? None but His own. Well, "He shall so
come in like manner as ye have seen him go into
heaven." <i>As</i> was the going, <i>so</i> shall be the coming, if
we are to bow to Scripture. To confound the day of
the Lord with His coming for His church is to overlook
the plainest teachings of Scripture, and to rob the believer
of his own true and proper hope.</p>

<p>And here perhaps we cannot do better than to call the
attention of the reader to a very important and interesting
passage in the second Epistle of Peter: "For we
have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made
known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty. For he
received from God the Father honor and glory, when
there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory,
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
And this voice which came from heaven we heard when
we were with him in the holy mount. We have also the
word of prophecy more sure [or confirmed], whereunto
ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth
in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise
in your hearts" (chap. i. 16-19).</p>

<p>This passage demands the reader's most attentive consideration.
It sets forth, in the clearest possible manner,
the distinction between "the word of prophecy" and the
proper hope of the Christian, namely, "the morning
star." We must remember that the great subject of
prophecy is God's government of the world in connection
with the seed of Abraham. "When the Most High
divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated
the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people
according to the number of the children of Israel. For
the Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
inheritance" (Deut. xxxii. 8, 9).</p>

<p>Here then is the scope and theme of prophecy&mdash;Israel
and the nations. A child can understand this. If we
range through the prophets, from the opening of Isaiah
to the close of Malachi, we shall not find so much as a
single line about the church of God&mdash;its position, its
portion, or its prospects. No doubt the word of prophecy
is deeply interesting, and most profitable for the Christian
to study; but it will be all this just in proportion as he
understands its proper scope and object, and sees how it
stands in contrast with his own special hope. We may
fearlessly assert that it is as utterly impossible for any
one to study the Old Testament prophecies aright who
does not clearly see the true place of the church.</p>

<p>We cannot attempt to enter upon the subject of the
church in this brief paper. It has been repeatedly referred
to and unfolded elsewhere, and we can now merely
ask the reader to weigh and examine the statement which
we here deliberately make, namely, that there is not so
much as a single syllable about the church of God, the
body of Christ, from cover to cover of the Old Testament.
Types, shadows, illustrations, there are which,
now that we have the full-orbed light of the New Testament,
we can see, understand, and appreciate. But it
was not possible for any Old Testament believer to see
the great mystery of Christ and the church, inasmuch as
it was not revealed. The inspired apostle expressly tells
us that it was "<i>hid</i>," not in the Old Testament Scriptures,
but "in God," as we read in Ephesians iii., "And
to make all men see what is the fellowship [or rather the
administration] of the mystery, which from the beginning
of the world hath been <i>hid in God</i>, who created all
things by Jesus Christ" (verse 9). So also in Colossians
we read, "Even the mystery which <i>hath been hid</i> from
ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his
saints" (chap. i. 26).</p>

<p>These two passages establish the truth of our statement
beyond all question, for those who are willing to be
governed absolutely by the authority of holy Scripture;
they teach us that the great mystery&mdash;Christ and the
church&mdash;is not to be found in the Old Testament. Where
have we in the Old Testament a word about Jews and
Gentiles forming one body, and being united by the
Holy Ghost to a living head in heaven? How could
such a thing possibly be, so long as "the middle wall of
partition" stood as an insuperable barrier between the
circumcised and the uncircumcised? If one were asked
to name a special feature of the old economy he would
at once reply, "The rigid separation of Jew and Gentile."
On the other hand, if he were asked to name a
special feature of the church, or Christianity, he would as
readily reply, "The intimate union of Jew and Gentile
in one body." In short, the two conditions stand in
vivid contrast, and it was wholly impossible that both
could hold good at the same time. So long as the middle
wall of partition stood, the truth of the church could
not be revealed; but the death of Christ having thrown
down that wall, the Holy Ghost descended from heaven
to form the one body, and link it, by His presence and
indwelling, to the risen and glorified Head in the heavens.
Such is the great mystery of Christ and the church,
for which there could be no less a basis than accomplished
redemption.</p>

<p>Now we entreat the reader to examine this matter for
himself. Let him search the Scriptures to see if these
things be indeed true. This is the only way to get at
the truth. We must lay aside all our own thoughts and
reasonings, our prejudices and predilections, and come,
like a little child, to the holy Scriptures. In this way we
shall learn the mind of God on this most precious and
interesting subject. We shall find that the church of
God, the body of Christ, did not exist, as a fact, until
after the resurrection and ascension of Christ, and the
consequent descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost.
And further, we shall find that the full and
glorious doctrine of the church was not brought out until
the days of the Apostle Paul (compare Rom. xvi. 25, 26;
Eph. i.-iii.; Col. i. 25-29). Finally, we shall see that
the actual and unmistakable boundary lines of the
church's earthly history are Pentecost (Acts ii.) and the
rapture or taking up of the saints (1 Thess. iv. 13-17).</p>

<p>Thus we reach a position from which we can get a view
of the church's proper hope; and that hope is, most assuredly,
"the bright and morning star." Of this hope
the Old Testament prophets utter not a syllable. They
speak largely and clearly of "The day of the Lord"&mdash;a
day of judgment upon the world and its ways (see Isaiah
ii. 12-22 and parallel Scriptures). But "the day of the
Lord," with all its attendant circumstances of wrath,
judgment, and terror, must never be confounded with
His coming for His people. When our blessed Lord
comes <i>for</i> His people there will be nothing to terrify.
He will come in all the sweetness and tenderness of His
love to receive His loved and redeemed people to Himself.
He will come to finish up the precious story of His
grace. "To them that look for Him shall He appear
(&#959;&#966;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;) the second time, without [that is, apart from
all question of] sin, unto salvation" (Heb. ix).<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He will
come as a bridegroom to receive the bride; and when
He thus comes none but His own shall hear His voice or
see His face. If He were to come this very night for His
people&mdash;and He may, for aught we know&mdash;if the voice of
the archangel and the trump of God were to be heard to-night,
then all the dead in Christ&mdash;all who have been
laid to sleep by Jesus&mdash;all the saints of God, both those
of old Testament and New Testament times, who lie
sleeping in our cemeteries and graveyards, or in the
ocean's depths&mdash;all these would rise from their temporary
sleep. All the living saints would be changed in a moment,
and all would be caught up to meet their descending
Lord, and return with Him to the Father's house
(John xiv. 3; 1 Thess. iv. 16, 17; 1 Cor. xv. 51, 52).</p>

<p>This is what is meant by the rapture or catching up of
the saints, and has nothing to do directly with Israel or
the nations. It is the distinct and only proper hope of
the church; and there is not so much as a single hint of
it in the entire Old Testament. If any one asserts that
there is, let him produce it. If there be such a thing,
nothing is easier than to furnish it. We solemnly and
deliberately declare there is no such thing. For all that
respects the church&mdash;its standing, its calling, its portion,
its prospects&mdash;we must turn to the pages of the New
Testament, and, of those pages, mainly the Epistles of
Paul. To confound "the word of prophecy" with the
hope of the church is to damage the truth of God, and
mislead the souls of His people. That the enemy has
succeeded in doing all this, throughout the length and
breadth of the professing church, is, alas! too true.
And hence it is that so very few Christians have really
Scriptural thoughts about the coming of their Lord.
They are looking into prophecy for the church's hope&mdash;they
confound "the Sun of righteousness" with "the
Morning Star"&mdash;they mix up the coming of Christ <i>for</i>
His people, and His coming <i>with</i> them&mdash;they make His
"coming" or "state of presence" to be identical with
His "appearing" or "manifestation."</p>

<p>All this is a most serious mistake, against which we
desire to warn our readers. When Christ comes with
His people, "every eye shall see him." When He is
manifested, His people will be manifested also. "When
Christ our life shall appear [or be manifested], then shall
ye also appear with him in glory" (Col. iii. 4). When
Christ comes to execute judgment, His saints come with
Him. "Behold, the Lord cometh <i>with</i> ten thousand of
his saints, to execute judgment upon all" (Jude 14, 15).
So also in Revelation xix., the rider on the white horse
is followed by the armies in heaven upon white horses,
clothed in fine linen, white and clean. These armies are
not angels, but saints; for we do not read of angels being
clothed in white linen, which is expressly declared, in
this very chapter, to be "the righteousness of saints"
(verse 8).</p>

<p>Now, it is most evident that, if the saints accompany
their Lord when He comes in judgment, they must be
with Him previously. The fact of their going to Him is
not presented in the book of Revelation, unless it be involved&mdash;as
we doubt not it is&mdash;in the catching up of the
man child, in chapter xii. The man child is, most surely,
Christ; and inasmuch as Christ and His people are indissolubly
joined in one, they are most completely identified
with Him, blessed for ever be His holy and precious
name!</p>

<p>But, clearly, it does not at all lie within the scope of
the book of Revelation to give us the coming of Christ
<i>for</i> His people, or their being caught up to meet Him in
the air, or their return to the Father's house. For these
blessed events or facts, we must look elsewhere, as, for
example, in John xiv. 3; 1 Corinthians xv. 23, 51, 52;
1 Thessalonians iv. 14-17. Let the reader ponder these
three passages. Let him drink into his very soul their
clear and precious teaching. There is nothing difficult
about them, no obscurity, no mist or vagueness whatever.
A babe in Christ can understand them. They set forth,
in the clearest and simplest possible manner, the true
Christian hope, which&mdash;we repeat it emphatically, and
urge it upon the reader as the direct and positive teaching
of holy Scripture&mdash;is the coming of Christ to receive
His people, all His people, to Himself, to take them back
with Him to His Father's house, there to remain with
Him, while God deals governmentally with Israel and
the nations, and prepares the way, by His judicial actings,
for bringing in the First-begotten into the world.</p>

<p>Now, if it be asked, "Why have we not the coming of
Christ for His people in the book of Revelation?" Because
that book is pre-eminently a book of judgment&mdash;a
governmental, judicial book, at least from chapter i.-xx.
Hence even the church is presented as under judgment.
We do not see the church in chapters ii. and iii. as the
body or the bride of Christ; but as a responsible witness
on the earth, whose condition is being carefully examined
and rigidly judged by Him who walks amongst the
candlesticks.</p>

<p>It would not, therefore, comport with the character or
object of this book to introduce, directly, the rapture of
the saints. It shows us the church on the earth, in the
place of responsibility. This it gives us, in chapters ii.
and iii., under the head of "the things that are." But
from that to chapter xix. there is not a single syllable
about the church on earth. The plain fact is, the church
will not be on earth during that solemn period. She will
be with her Head and Lord, in the divine retirement of
the Father's house. The redeemed are seen in heaven,
under the title of the twenty-four crowned elders, in
chapters iv., v. There, blessed be God, they will be,
while the seals are being opened, the trumpets sounded,
and the vials poured out. To think of the church as
being on the earth, from Revelation vi.-xviii.&mdash;to place
her amid the apocalyptic judgments&mdash;to pass her through
"the great tribulation"&mdash;to subject her to "the hour of
temptation which shall come upon all the world, to try
them that dwell upon the earth"&mdash;would be to falsify her
position, to rob her of her chartered privileges, and to
contradict the clear and positive promise of her Lord.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>No, no, beloved Christian reader; let no man deceive
you, by any means. The church is seen on earth in
Revelation ii., iii. She is seen in heaven, together with
the Old Testament saints, in chapters iv., v. We are not
told, in the Revelation, how she gets there; but we see her
there, in high communion and holy worship; and then,
in chapter xix., the rider on the white horse comes forth,
<i>with</i> His saints, to execute judgment upon the beast and
the false prophet&mdash;to put down every enemy and every
evil, and to reign over the whole earth for the blissful
period of a thousand years.</p>

<p>Such is the plain teaching of the New Testament, to
which we earnestly invite the attention of our readers.
And let no one suppose that our object is to find an easy
path for Christians in thus teaching, as we do most
emphatically, that the church will not be in "the great
tribulation"&mdash;will not come into "the hour of temptation."
Nothing of the kind. The fact is, the true and
normal condition of the church, and therefore of the individual
Christian, in this world, is tribulation. So says
our Lord: "In the world ye shall have tribulation."
And again, "We glory in tribulation."</p>

<p>It cannot, therefore, be a question of avoiding that
which is our appointed portion in this world, if only we
are true to Christ. But the fact is, that the entire truth
of the church's position and prospect is involved in this
question, and this is our reason for urging it so upon the
prayerful attention of our readers.</p>

<p>The great object of the enemy is to drag down the
church of God to an earthly level&mdash;to set Christians entirely
astray as to their divinely appointed hope&mdash;to lead
them to confound things which God has made to differ,
to occupy them with earthly things&mdash;to cause them to so
mix up the <i>coming</i> of Christ for His people with His <i>appearing</i>
in judgment upon the world, that they may not
be able to cultivate those bridal affections and heavenly
aspirations which become them as members of the body
of Christ. He would fain have them looking out for
various earthly events to come between them and their
own proper hope, in order that they may not be&mdash;as God
would have them&mdash;ever on the very tip-toe of expectation,
looking out, with ardent desire, for the appearing
of "the bright and morning Star."</p>

<p>Well doth the enemy know what he is about; and
surely we ought not to be ignorant of his devices, but
rather give ourselves to the study of the word of God,
and thus learn, as we most surely shall, "the double
bearing" of the glorious fact of the Lord's coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32k" id="Page_32k">&nbsp;</a></span></p>
<h3>"THE COMING" AND "THE DAY."</h3>

<p>We must now ask the reader to turn with us for a little
to the two epistles to the Thessalonians. As we have
already remarked, these Christians were converted to the
blessed hope of the Lord's return. They were taught to
look for Him day by day. It was not merely the doctrine
of the advent received and held in the mind, but a
divine Person constantly expected by hearts that had
learnt to love Him and long for His coming.</p>

<p>But, as we can easily imagine, the Thessalonian Christians
were ignorant of many things connected with this
blessed hope. The apostle had been "<i>taken</i> from them
for a short time, in presence, not in heart." He had not
been allowed to remain long enough amongst them to instruct
them in the details of the subject of their hope.
They knew that Jesus was to return&mdash;that self-same
blessed One who had graciously delivered them from the
wrath to come. But as to any distinction between His
coming <i>for</i> His people and coming <i>with</i> them&mdash;between
His "state of presence" and His "appearing"&mdash;His
"coming" and His "day," they were, at first, wholly
ignorant.</p>

<p>Hence, as might be expected, they fell into various
errors and mistakes. It is wonderful how speedily the
human mind wanders away into the wildest and grossest
confusion and error. We need to be guarded on all sides
by the pure, solid, all-adjusting truth of God. We must
have our souls evenly balanced by divine revelation, else
we are sure to plunge into all manner of false and foolish
notions. Thus some of the Thessalonians conceived the
idea of giving up their honest callings. They ceased
to labor with their hands, and went about idle.</p>

<p>This was a great mistake. Even though we were perfectly
certain that our Lord would come this very night,
it would be no reason why we should not, most diligently
and faithfully, attend to our daily round of duty, and do all
that devolved upon us in that particular sphere in which
His good hand has placed us. So far from this, the very
fact of expecting the blessed Master would strengthen our
desire to have everything done as it ought to be up to the
very moment of His return, so that not so much as a
single righteous claim should be left neglected. In point
of fact, the hope of the Lord's speedy return, when held
in power in the soul, is most sanctifying, purifying, and
adjusting in its influence upon Christian life, conduct,
and character. We know, alas! that even this most
glorious truth may be held in the region of the understanding,
and flippantly professed with the lips, while the
heart and the life, the course, conduct, and character, remain
wholly unaffected by it. But we are expressly
taught by the inspired Apostle John, that "every man
that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he
is pure" (1 John iii. 3). And, most surely, this "purifying"
embraces all that which goes to make up our whole
practical life, from day to day.</p>

<p>But there was another grave mistake into which those
dear Thessalonians fell, and out of which the blessed
apostle, like a true and faithful pastor, sought to recover
them. They imagined that their departed Christian
friends would not have part in the joy of the Lord's return.
They feared that they would fail to participate in
that blissful and longed-for moment.</p>

<p>Now while it is quite true that this very mistake proves
how vividly these Christians realized their blessed hope,
still it was a mistake, and needed to be corrected. But
let us carefully note the correction: "I would not have
you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are
asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no
hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
even so them also which sleep in Jesus [or are laid to
sleep by Jesus] will God bring with him."</p>

<p>Mark this. He does not seek to comfort these sorrowing
friends by the assurance that they should, ere long,
follow the departed. Quite the reverse. He assures
them that Jesus would bring the departed back with Him.
This is plain and distinct, and founded upon the great
fact that "Jesus died for us and rose again."</p>

<p>But the apostle does not stop here, but goes on to pour
a flood of fresh light upon the understanding of His dear
children in the faith. "For this we say unto you by
the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain
unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent [or
precede] them which are asleep. For the Lord himself
shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead
in Christ shall rise first [that is, before the living are
changed]. Then we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in [the] clouds, to meet
the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the
Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words."</p>

<p>Here, then, we have presented to us what is commonly
spoken of amongst us as the rapture of the saints&mdash;a most
glorious, soul-stirring, and enrapturing theme surely&mdash;the
brightest hope of the church of God, and of the individual
believer. The Lord <i>Himself</i> shall descend from
heaven with a summons designed only for the ears and
the hearts of His own. Not one uncircumcised ear shall
hear&mdash;not one unrenewed heart be moved by, that heavenly
voice, that divine trumpet call. The dead in Christ,
including, as we believe, the Old Testament saints, as
well as those of the New, who shall have departed in the
faith of Christ&mdash;all those shall hear the blessed sound, and
come forth from their sleeping places. All the living
saints shall hear it, and be changed in a moment. And
oh! what a change! The poor crumbling tabernacle of
clay exchanged for a glorified body, like unto the body
of Jesus.</p>

<p>Look at yonder bent and withered frame&mdash;that body
racked with pain, and worn out with years of acute suffering.
It is the body of a saint. How humiliating to see it
like that! Yes; but wait a little. Let but the trumpet
sound, and in one moment that poor crushed and withered
frame shall be changed, and made like to the glorified
body of the descending Lord.</p>

<p>And there, in yonder lunatic asylum, is a poor lunatic.
He has been there for years. He is a saint of God. How
mysterious! True; we cannot fathom the mystery; it
lies beyond our present narrow range. But so it is; that
poor lunatic is a saint of God, an heir of glory. He too
shall hear the voice of the archangel and the trump of
God, and leave his lunacy behind him for ever, while he
mounts into the heavens, in his glorified body, to meet
his descending Lord.</p>

<p>Oh! reader, what a brilliant moment! How many
sick chambers and beds of languishing shall be vacant
then! What marvellous changes shall then take place!
How the heart bounds at the thought, and longs to sing,
in full chorus, that lovely hymn,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Christ, the Lord, will come again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None shall wait for Him in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall then His glory see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christ will come and call for me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then, when the archangel's voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls the sleeping saints to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising millions shall proclaim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessings on the Saviour's name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'This is our redeeming God!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ransomed hosts will shout aloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praise, eternal praise, be given.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Lord of earth and heaven!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Amen and amen!</p>

<p>How glorious the thought of those "rising millions!"
How truly delightful to be amongst them! How precious
the hope of seeing that blessed One who loveth us and
who gave Himself for us! Such is the hope of the Christian,
a hope concerning which there is not a single line
from cover to cover of the Old Testament. "The word
of prophecy" is of all importance. We do well to take
heed to it. It is an unspeakable mercy for those who
find themselves in a dark place to have a bright lamp to
cast its light athwart the gloom. But let the Christian
bear in mind that what he wants is to have "the day star
arising in his heart;" in other words, to have his whole
heart governed by the hope of seeing Jesus as the bright
and morning Star. When the heart is thus filled and
ruled by the proper Christian hope, then the eye can intelligently
scan the prophetic chart: it can take in the
whole field of prophecy as our God has graciously
opened it before us, and find interest and profit in every
page and in every line. But, on the other hand, we may
rest assured that the man who looks into prophecy in order
to find the church or its hope there has his face
turned the wrong way. He will find "the Jew" there,
and "Gentile" there, but not "the church of God."
We earnestly trust that not one of our readers will fail to
lay hold of this fact&mdash;a fact, we may safely say, of the
very deepest moment.</p>

<p>But it will perhaps be asked, "Of what use, then, is
prophecy? If indeed it be true that we cannot find
aught about the church on the prophetic page, of what
possible use can it be to Christians? Why should we be
told to take heed to it if it does not immediately concern
us?" We reply, Is nothing of any value to us save what
immediately concerns ourselves? Shall we take no interest
in anything unless we ourselves form the immediate
subject thereof? Is it nothing to us to have the counsels
and purposes and plans of God laid open before us? Do
we lightly esteem the high favor of having the thoughts
of God communicated to us in His holy word of prophecy?
Surely it was not thus that Abraham treated the
divine communications made to him in Genesis xviii.:
"Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?"
And what was that thing? Did it immediately concern
Abraham? Not at all. It concerned Sodom and the
neighboring cities, and Abraham had no stake in them.
But did that prevent his interest in the divine communication.
Did it hinder his appreciation of the mark of
special favor in his being made the honored and trusted
depository of the thoughts of God? Surely not. We
may safely assert that the faithful patriarch highly
esteemed the privilege conferred upon him.</p>

<p>And so should we. We should study prophecy with all
the interest arising from the fact that therein we have
unfolded to us, with divine precision, what God is about
to do on this earth with Israel and with the nations.
Prophecy is God's history of the future; and just in proportion
as we love Him shall we delight to study His history;
not indeed, as some have said, that we may know
its truth by its fulfilment, but that we may possess all
that absolute, that divine certainty as to the future which
God's word is capable of imparting. Nothing can be
more absurd, in the judgment of faith, than to suppose
that we must wait until the accomplishment of a prophecy
to know that it is true. What an insult offered&mdash;unwittingly,
no doubt&mdash;to the peerless revelation of our God.</p>

<p>But we must now turn, for a moment, to the solemn
subject of "The Day of the Lord." This is a term of
frequent occurrence in Old Testament Scriptures. We
cannot attempt to quote all the passages; but we shall
refer to one or two, and then the reader can follow up the
subject for himself.</p>

<p>In Isaiah ii. we read, "For the day of the Lord of
hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and
upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought
low.... And the loftiness of man shall be bowed
down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low:
and the Lord alone shall be exalted <i>in that day</i>. And the
idols he shall utterly abolish. And they shall go into the
holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for
fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when
he ariseth to shake terribly the earth."</p>

<p>So also in Joel ii. "Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and
sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants
of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord
cometh, for it is nigh at hand. A day of darkness and of
gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as
the morning spread upon the mountains; a great people
and a strong; there has not been ever the like, neither
shall be any more after it, even to the years of many
generations; ... the earth shall quake before them; the
heavens shall tremble; the sun and the moon shall be
dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining; ...
for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and
who can abide it?"</p>

<p>From these and similar passages, we learn that "the
day of the Lord" stands associated with the deeply
solemn thought of judgment upon the world&mdash;upon apostate
Israel&mdash;upon man and his ways&mdash;upon all that which
the human heart prizes and longs after. In short, the day
of the Lord stands in striking contrast with man's day.
Man has the upper hand now, the Lord will have the
upper hand then.</p>

<p>Now, while it is perfectly true that all the Lord's people
can rejoice in the prospect of that day, which, though it
will open in judgment upon the world, shall, nevertheless,
be marked by the universal reign of righteousness;
yet we must remember that the peculiar hope of the
Christian is not the day with its awful accompaniments of
judgment, wrath, and terror; but the coming or presence
of Jesus, with its precious accompaniments of peace and
joy, love and glory. The church shall have met her
Lord, and returned with Him to the Father's house, before
that terrible day bursts upon the world. It will be
her blissful portion to taste the ineffable communion of
that heavenly home, for an indefinite period previous to
the opening of the day of the Lord. Her eyes shall be
gladdened by the sight of "the bright and morning
Star," long before even "the Sun of righteousness" shall
arise, in healing virtue, upon the pious portion of the
nation of Israel&mdash;the God-fearing remnant of the seed of
Abraham.</p>

<p>We are intensely anxious that the Christian reader
should thoroughly enter into this grand and important
distinction. We feel persuaded that it will have an immense
effect upon all his thoughts and views and hopes
of the future. It will enable him to see, without a single
intervening cloud, his true prospect as a Christian. It
will deliver him from all mist, vagueness, and confusion;
and further, it will divest his mind of all that feeling of
dread with which so many even of the Lord's dear people
contemplate the future. It will teach him to look for the
Saviour&mdash;the blessed Bridegroom&mdash;the everlasting Lover
of his soul, and not for judgments and terror, eclipses and
earthquakes, convulsions and revolutions, it will keep his
spirit tranquil and happy, in the sure and certain hope of
being with Jesus, ere that great and terrible day of the
Lord come.</p>

<p>See how the faithful apostle labored to lead his dear
Thessalonian converts into the clear understanding of the
difference of "the coming" and "the day."</p>

<p>"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have
no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly
that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
night. For when <i>they</i> [not ye] shall say, Peace and
safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as
travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not
escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that
day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children
of light, and the children of the day; we are not of
the night, nor of darkness"&mdash;The Lord be praised!&mdash;"Therefore
let us not sleep, as do others; but let us
watch and be sober. For they that sleep, sleep in the
night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the
night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting
on the breastplate of faith and love, and for an helmet,
the hope of salvation. For God hath not appointed us to
wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep [that is,
are dead or alive] we should live together with him.
Wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another,
even as also ye do" (1 Thessalonians v. 1-11).</p>

<p>Here we have the distinction set forth with unmistakable
clearness. The Lord Himself shall come for us as the
Bridegroom. The day of the Lord shall come upon the
world as a thief. Is it possible for contrast to be more
striking? How can any one confound these two things?
They are as distinct as any two things can be. A bridegroom
and a thief are surely two different things; and
just as different are the coming of the Lord for His waiting
people and the coming of His day upon a slumbering
or intoxicated world.</p>

<p>Some perhaps may find a difficulty in the fact that the
church in Sardis is addressed in such solemn words as
these, "If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on
thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will
come upon thee" (Rev. iii. 3). The difficulty will vanish
when we reflect that, in the case of Sardis, the professing
body is looked upon as having a mere name to live while
dead. It has sunk to the level of the world, and can only
see things from the world's standpoint. The church has
failed utterly; it has fallen from its high and holy position;
it is under judgment; it cannot therefore be
cheered by the church's proper hope; but is threatened
by the world's terrible doom. We do not see the church
here as the body or bride of Christ, but as the responsible
witness for God on the earth&mdash;the golden candlestick
which ought to have held forth the divine light of testimony
in this dark world, in the absence of her Lord.
But alas! the professing church has sunk lower and become
darker than even the world itself. Hence the
solemn threatening. The exception confirms the rule.</p>

<p>We shall proceed with this subject as presented in
2 Thessalonians.</p>

<p>It is a fact full of the richest comfort and consolation to
the heart of a true believer, that our God, in His marvellous
grace, ever makes the eater to yield meat, and the
strong, sweetness. He brings light out of darkness, life
out of death, and causes the bright beams of His glory to
shine amid the most disastrous ruin caused by the enemy's
hand. The truth of this is illustrated on every page of
the inspired volume, and it should fill our hearts with
peace and our mouths with praise.</p>

<p>Hence it is that the varied doctrinal errors and practical
evils, into which the early Christians were permitted to
fall, have been overruled of God, and used for the instruction,
guidance, and solid profit of the church to the close
of her earthly history.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, the error of the Thessalonian
Christians in reference to their departed brethren was
made the occasion of pouring such a flood of divine light
upon the Lord's coming, and upon the rapture of the
saints, that it is impossible for any simple mind that
bows to Scripture ever to fall into a similar mistake.
They looked for the Lord to come, and in that they were
right. They expected Him to set up His kingdom on
the earth, and in that they were right, as to the broad
fact.</p>

<p>But they made a great mistake in leaving out the heavenly
side of this glorious hope. Their intelligence was defective&mdash;their
faith lacking. They did not see the two
parts&mdash;the double bearing of the advent of Christ&mdash;His
descent into the air to receive His people to Himself, and
His appearing in glory to set up His kingdom in manifested
power. Hence they feared that their departed
brethren would necessarily be absent from the sphere of
blessing&mdash;the circle of glory. This mistake is divinely
corrected, as we have seen, in the first epistle, chapter iv.
The heavenly side of the hope&mdash;the Christian's proper
portion&mdash;is placed before the heart as the true corrective
for the error in reference to the sleeping saints. Christ
will gather all (and not merely part of) His people to
Himself; and if there is to be any advantage&mdash;a shade
of difference in the matter&mdash;it will be on the side of
those very people about whom they were mourning.
"The dead in Christ shall rise first."</p>

<p>But from the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians we
learn that those dear young converts had been led into
another grave error&mdash;an error, not as to the dead, but as
to the living&mdash;a mistake, not respecting "the coming,"
but respecting "the day of the Lord." In the one case
they feared that the dead would not participate in thy
blissful triumph of "the coming;" and in the other
case they feared that the living were actually, at the very
moment, involved in the terrors of the day.</p>

<p>Such is the mistake with which the inspired apostle
deals in his second letter to the Thessalonian believers;
and nothing can exceed the tenderness and delicacy, and
yet withal the wisdom and faithfulness of his dealing.</p>

<p>The Christians at Thessalonica were passing through
intense persecution and tribulation; and it is very evident
that the enemy, by means of false teachers, sought
to upset their minds, by leading them to think that "the
great and terrible day of the Lord" had actually arrived,
and that the troubles through which they were passing
were the accompaniments of that day. If this were so
the entire teaching of the apostle was proved false; for
if there was one truth that shone forth more brightly and
prominently in his teaching than another, it was the association
and identification of believers with Christ&mdash;an
association so intimate, an identification so close, that it
was impossible for Christ to appear in glory without His
people. "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear,
then shall ye also appear with him in glory." But He
must appear in order to introduce "the day."</p>

<p>Furthermore, when the day of the Lord does actually
arrive it will not be to trouble His people, but, on the
contrary, to trouble their persecutors. Of this the apostle
reminds them, in the most simple, forcible manner, in
his very opening lines: "We are bound to thank God
always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your
faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one
of you all toward each other aboundeth, so that we ourselves
glory in you in the churches of God for your
patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations
that ye endure: which is a manifest token of the
righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted
worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
seeing <i>it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation
to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled
rest with us</i>, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking
vengeance on them that know not God [Gentiles], and
that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
[Jews]" (chapter i. 3-8).</p>

<p>Thus, not only was the Christian position involved in
this matter, but the very glory of God&mdash;His actual
righteousness. If, indeed, the day of the Lord brought
tribulation to Christians, then was there no truth in the
doctrine&mdash;the grand prominent doctrine of Paul's teaching&mdash;that
Christ and His people are one; and moreover
it would impugn the righteousness of God. In short,
then, if Christians were in tribulation, it was morally
impossible that the day of the Lord could have set in, for
when that day comes, it will be rest for believers, as their
public recompense, in the kingdom&mdash;not merely in the
Father's house; which is not the point here. The tables
will be completely turned. The church will be in rest,
the church's troublers in tribulation. During man's day,
the church is called to tribulation; but in the day of the
Lord all will be reversed.</p>

<p>Let the reader note this carefully. It is not the question
of Christians suffering tribulation. They are actually
called to it in this world, so long as wickedness has the
upper hand. Christ suffered, and so must they. But the
point we want to fasten upon the mind and heart of the
Christian is, that when Christ comes to set up His kingdom,
it is utterly impossible that His people can be in
trouble. Thus the entire teaching of the enemy, by
which he sought to upset the Thessalonian believers, was
proved to be utterly fallacious. The apostle sweeps away
the very foundation of the whole fabric by the simple
statement of the precious truth of God. This is the
divine way of delivering people from false notions and
vain fears. Give them the truth, and error must flee before
it. Let in the sunshine of God's eternal word, and
all the mists and clouds of false doctrine must be rolled
away.</p>

<p>But let us, for a moment, examine the further teaching
of our apostle, in this remarkable writing. In so doing,
we shall see how thoroughly he establishes the distinction
between "the coming" and "the day"&mdash;a distinction
which the reader will do well to ponder.</p>

<p>"Now we beseech you, brethren, by [or on the ground
of] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering
together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in
mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor
by letter, as from us, as that the day of the Lord is
present."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Now, apart altogether from the question of various
readings, a moment's reflection will suffice to show the
simple minded Christian that the apostle could not possibly
mean to teach the Thessalonians that the day of the
Lord was not, even then, at hand. Scripture can never
contradict itself. No one sentence of divine revelation
can possibly collide with another. But if the reading
given in our excellent Authorized Version were correct, it
would stand in direct opposition to Romans xiii. 12,
where we are plainly and expressly told that "the day is
at hand." What "day?" The day of the Lord, most
surely, which is always the term used in connection with
our individual responsibility in walk and service.</p>

<p>This, we may remark in passing, is a point of much
interest and practical value. If the reader will take the
trouble to examine the various passages in which "the
day" is spoken of, he will find that they have reference,
more or less, to the question of work, service or responsibility.
For instance, "That ye may be blameless [not
at the <i>coming</i>, but] in the <i>day</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ"
(1 Cor. i. 8). Again, "Every man's work shall be made
manifest, for the <i>day</i> shall declare it" (1 Cor. iii. 13).
"Without offence till the day of Christ" (Phil. i. 10).
"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me
at <i>that day</i>" (2 Timothy iv. 8).</p>

<p>From all these passages, and many more which might
be adduced, we learn that "the day of the Lord" will be
the grand time for reckoning with the workers; for the
divine appraisal of service; for the settling of all questions
of personal responsibility; for the distribution of
rewards&mdash;the "ten cities" and the "five cities."</p>

<p>Thus, wherever we turn, in whatever way we look at
the subject, we are more and more confirmed in the truth
of the clear distinction between our Lord's "coming," or
"state of presence," and His "appearing," or "day."
The former is ever held up before the heart as the bright
and blessed hope of the believer, which may be realized
at any moment. The latter is pressed rather upon the
conscience, in deep solemnity, as bearing upon the entire
practical career of those who are set in this world to work
and witness for an absent Lord. Scripture never confounds
these things, however much we may do it; nor is
there a single sentence from cover to cover of the holy
volume which teaches that believers are not always to be
looking out for the coming of the Lord, and eager to bear
in mind that "the day is at hand." It is only "that evil
servant"&mdash;referred to in our Lord's discourse in Matthew
xxiv.&mdash;that "says in his heart, My Lord delayeth his
coming;" and there we see the terrible results which
must ever flow from the harboring of such a thought in
the heart.</p>

<p>We shall now return for a moment to 2 Thessalonians
ii.&mdash;a passage of Scripture which has given rise to much
discussion amongst prophetic expositors, and presented
considerable difficulty to the students of prophecy.</p>

<p>It is very evident that the false teachers had been seeking
to disturb the minds of the Thessalonians by leading
them to think that they were, even then, surrounded by
the terrors of the day of the Lord. Not so, says the
apostle; that cannot be. Before ever that day opens we
must all be gathered to meet the Lord in the air. He
beseeches them, on the ground (&#965;&#960;&#949;&#961;) of the Lord's coming
and our gathering together unto Him, not to be
troubled about the day. He had already opened to them
the heavenly side of the Lord's coming. He had taught
them that they, as Christians, belonged to the day; that
their home and their portion and their hope were all in
that very region from which the day was to shine out. It
was wholly impossible, therefore, that the day of the
Lord could involve any terror or trouble to those who
were actually, through grace, the sons of the day.</p>

<p>But, further, even in looking at the subject from the
earthly side of it, the false teachers were all wrong. "Let
no man deceive you by any means: for [that day shall
not come] except there come a falling away first, and that
man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth
and exalteth himself above all that is called God,
or that is worshipped; so that he, as God, sitteth in the
temple of God, showing himself that he is God. Remember
ye not that when I was with you I told you
these things. And now ye know what withholdeth that
he might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of
iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth
will let, until he be taken out of the way. And then
shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with
the brightness of his coming [or the appearing of his
presence]. Even him whose coming is after the working
of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders,
and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them
that perish; because they received not the love of the
truth, that they might be saved" (verses 3-10).</p>

<p>Here, then, we are taught that ere the day of the Lord
arrives, the lawless one, the man of sin, the son of perdition,
must be revealed. The mystery of iniquity must
rise to a head. Man shall set himself up in open opposition
to God, nay, shall even assume to himself the name
and the worship of God. All this has to be developed on
the earth before that great and terrible day of the Lord
shall burst in judgment upon the scene. For the present
there is a barrier, a hindrance to the manifestation of this
awful personage. We are not told here what this barrier
or hindrance is. God may vary it at different times.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
But we learn, most distinctly, from the book of Revelation
that ere the mystery of iniquity culminates in the
person of the man of sin, the church shall have been removed
from this scene altogether. It is impossible to
read, with an enlightened eye, Revelation iv., v. and not
see that the church shall be in the very innermost circle
of heavenly glory ere a single seal is opened, a single
trumpet sounded, a single vial poured out. We do not
believe that any one can understand the book of the
Apocalypse who does not see this.</p>

<p>We may have occasion to go more freely into this profoundly
interesting point by-and-by. We can only now
entreat the reader to study the subject for himself. Let
him ponder Revelation iv., v., and ask God to interpret
their precious contents to his soul. In this way we feel
persuaded that he will learn that the twenty-four crowned
elders set forth the heavenly saints, who shall be gathered
round the Lamb, in glory, before a single line of the prophetic
portion of the book is fulfilled.</p>

<p>And here we must close this paper; but ere doing so
we should like to put a very plain question to the reader&mdash;a
question which can only be answered rightly in the immediate
presence of God. It is this, What is it thou art
looking for? What is thy hope? Art thou looking forward
to certain events which are to transpire on this
earth, such as the revival of the Roman empire, the development
of the ten kingdoms; the gathering back of the
Jews to their own land of Palestine; the rebuilding of
Jerusalem; the appearance of Antichrist; the great tribulation;
and finally, the appalling judgments which shall,
most surely, usher in the day of the Lord?</p>

<p>Say, beloved friend, are these the things which fill the
vision of thy soul? Is it for these thou art looking and
waiting? If so, be assured of it thou art not governed
by the church's proper hope. It is quite true that all
these things which we have named shall come to pass in
their appointed time; but not one of them should be allowed
to come between thee and thy proper hope. They
all stand on the prophetic page: they are all recorded in
God's history of the future; but they were never intended
to cast a shadow athwart the Christian's bright and
blessed hope. That hope stands forth in glorious relief
from the background of prophecy. What is it? Yes,
we again say, what is it? It is the appearing of the
bright and morning Star&mdash;the coming of the Lord Jesus,
the blessed Bridegroom of the church.</p>

<p>This, and naught else, is the true and proper hope of
the church of God. "I will give him the morning star"
(Rev. ii. 23). "Behold the bridegroom cometh" (Matt.
xxv.). When, we may ask, does the morning star appear
in the natural world? Just before the dawning of the
day. Who sees it? The one who has been watching
during the dark and dreary hours of the night. How
plain, how practical, how telling the application? The
church is supposed to be watching&mdash;to be lovingly wakeful&mdash;to
be looking out&mdash;to be putting forth that inquiry
of the intensely longing heart, "Why tarry the wheels of
his chariot?" Alas! the church has failed in this. But
that is no reason why the individual believer should not
be in the full present power of the blessed hope. "Let
<i>him</i> that heareth say, Come." This is deeply personal.
Oh! that the writer and the reader of these lines may
realize habitually the purifying, sanctifying, elevating
power of this heavenly hope! May we understand and
exhibit the practical power of those words of the apostle
John, "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth
himself, even as he is pure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49k" id="Page_49k">&nbsp;</a></span></p>
<h3>THE TWO RESURRECTIONS</h3>

<p>It may be that some of our readers will feel startled by
the title of this paper. Accustomed, from their earliest
days, to look at this great question through the medium
of Christendom's standards of doctrine and confessions of
faith, the idea of two resurrections has never once entered
their minds. Nevertheless Scripture does speak, in the
most distinct and unequivocal terms, of a "resurrection
of life," and a "resurrection of judgment"&mdash;two resurrections,
distinct in character, and distinct in time.</p>

<p>And not only so, but it informs us that there will be at
least a thousand years between the two. If men teach
otherwise&mdash;if they build up systems of divinity, and set
forth creeds and confessions of faith contrary to the direct
and positive teaching of holy Scripture, they must settle
that with their Lord, as must all who commit themselves
to their guidance. But remember, reader, it is your
bounden duty and ours to hearken only to the authority
of the word of God, and to bow down, in unqualified submission,
to its holy teaching.</p>

<p>Let us, then, reverently inquire, what saith the Scripture
on the subject indicated at the head of this article?
May God the Spirit guide and instruct!</p>

<p>We shall first quote that remarkable passage in chapter
v. of John's Gospel: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me,
hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment;
but is passed from death unto life. Verily, verily, I say
unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead
shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that
hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in himself;
so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and
hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because
he is the Son of man. Marvel not at this; for the
hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves
shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have
done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that
have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have, indicated in the most unmistakable
terms, the two resurrections. True, they are not distinguished
as to time, in this passage; but they are as to
character. We have a <i>life</i> resurrection; and a <i>judgment</i>
resurrection, and nothing can be more distinct than these.
There is no possible ground here on which to build the
theory of a promiscuous resurrection. The resurrection
of believers will be eclectic; it will be on the same principle,
and partake of the same character as the resurrection
of our blessed and adorable Lord; it will be a resurrection
from among the dead. It will be an act of divine
power, founded upon accomplished redemption, whereby
God will interpose on behalf of His sleeping saints, and
raise them up from among the dead, leaving the rest of
the dead in their graves for a thousand years (Revelation
xx. 5).</p>

<p>There is an interesting passage in Mark ix. which
throws great light on this subject. The opening verses
contain the record of the transfiguration; and then we
read, "As they came down from the mountain, he
charged them that they should tell no man what things
they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the
dead. And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning
one with another what the rising from [&#949;&#954;, from
among] the dead should mean."</p>

<p>The disciples felt that there was something special,
something entirely beyond the ordinary orthodox idea
of the resurrection of the dead, and verily so there was,
though they understood it not then. It lay beyond their
range of vision at that moment.</p>

<p>But let us turn to Philippians iii., and hearken to the
breathings of one who thoroughly entered into and appreciated
this grand Christian doctrine, and fondly
cherished this glorious and heavenly hope. "That I
may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable
unto his death: if by any means I might attain unto the
resurrection from among the dead" [&#949;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;]
(verses 10, 11).</p>

<p>A moment's just reflection will suffice to convince the
reader that the apostle is not speaking here of the great
broad truth of "the resurrection of the dead," inasmuch
as every one must rise again. But there was something
specific before the heart of this dear servant of Christ,
namely, "a resurrection from among the dead"&mdash;an
eclectic resurrection&mdash;a resurrection formed on the model
of Christ's resurrection. It was for this he longed continually.
This was the bright and blessed hope that
shone upon his soul and cheered him amid the sorrows
and trials, the toils and the difficulties, the buffetings and
the conflicts of his extraordinary career.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, "Does the apostle always use
this distinguishing little word (&#949;&#954;) when speaking of
resurrection?" Not always. Turn, for example, to Acts
xxiv. 15: "And have hope toward God, which they
themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection
of the dead, both of the just and unjust." Here, there is
no word to indicate the Christian or heavenly side of the
subject, for the simplest possible reason that the apostle
was speaking to those who were utterly incapable of
entering into the Christian's proper hope&mdash;far more incapable
than even the disciples in Mark ix. How could
he possibly unbosom himself in the presence of such men
as Tertullus, Ananias, and Felix? How could he speak
to them of his own specific and fondly cherished hope?
No; he could only take his stand on the great broad
truth of resurrection, common to all orthodox Jews.
Had he spoken of a "resurrection from among the dead,"
he could not have added the words, "which they themselves
also allow," for they did not "allow" anything of
the kind.</p>

<p>But oh! what a contrast between this precious servant
of Christ, defending himself from his accusers, in Acts
xxiv., and unbosoming himself to his beloved brethren,
in Philippians iii.! To the latter he can speak of the
true Christian hope in the full-orbed light which the glory
of Christ pours upon it. He can give utterance to the
inmost thoughts, feelings, and aspirations of that great,
large, loving heart, with its earnest throbbings after the
life-resurrection in the which he shall be satisfied as he
wakes up in the likeness of his blessed Lord.</p>

<p>But we must return, for a moment, to our first quotation,
from John v. It may perhaps present a difficulty
to some of our readers in laying hold of the truth of the
Christian's hope of resurrection, that our Lord makes use
of the word "hour" in speaking of the two classes.
"How," it is argued, "can there be a thousand years
between the two resurrections, when our Lord expressly
tells us that all shall occur within the limits of an hour?"</p>

<p>To this question we have a double reply. In the first
place, we find our Lord making use of the self-same word,
"hour," at verse 25, where He is speaking of the great
and glorious work of quickening dead souls. "Verily,
verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God;
and they that hear shall live."</p>

<p>Now, here we have a work which has been going on for
nearly nineteen long centuries. During all that time,
here spoken of as an "hour," the voice of Jesus, the Son
of God, has been heard calling precious souls from death
to life. If, therefore, in the very same discourse, our
Lord used the word "hour" when speaking of a period
which has already extended to well-nigh two thousand
years, what difficulty can there be in applying the word
to a period of one thousand years?</p>

<p>Surely, none whatever, as we judge. But even if any
little difficulty yet remained it must be thoroughly met
by the direct testimony of the Holy Ghost in Revelation
xx., where we read, "But the rest of the dead lived not
again till the thousand years were finished. <i>This is the
first resurrection.</i> Blessed and holy is he that hath part
in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath
no power, but they shall be priests of God, and of Christ,
and shall reign with him a thousand years" (verses 5, 6).</p>

<p>This settles the question absolutely and forever, for all
those who are willing to be taught exclusively by holy
Scripture, as every true Christian ought to be. There
will be two resurrections, the first and the second: and
there will be a thousand years between the two. To the
former belong all the Old Testament saints&mdash;referred to
in Hebrews xii. under the title of the spirits of just men
made perfect&mdash;then the church of the firstborn ones&mdash;and
finally all those who shall be put to death during "the
great tribulation," and throughout the entire period between
the rapture of the saints and the appearing of
Christ in judgment upon the beast and his armies, in
Revelation xix.</p>

<p>To the latter, on the other hand, belong all those who
shall have died in their sins, from the days of Cain, in
Genesis iv., down to the last apostate from millennial
glory, in Revelation xx.</p>

<p>How solemn is all this! How real! How soul-subduing!
If our Lord were to come to-night what a scene
would be enacted in all our cemeteries and graveyards!
What tongue, what pen can portray&mdash;what heart can conceive&mdash;the
grand realities of such a moment? There are
thousands of tombs in which lie mingled the ashes of the
dead <i>in</i> Christ and the ashes of the dead <i>out</i> of Christ.
In many a family vault may be found the ashes of both.
Well, then, when the voice of the archangel is heard all
the sleeping saints shall rise from their graves, leaving
behind them those who have died in their sins, to remain
in the darkness and silence of the tomb for a thousand
years.</p>

<p>Yes, reader, such is the direct and simple testimony of
the word of God. True, it does not enter into any
curious details. It does not furnish any food for a morbid
imagination or idle curiosity. But it sets forth the
solemn and weighty fact of a first and second resurrection&mdash;a
resurrection of life and everlasting glory, and a
resurrection of judgment and everlasting misery. There
is, positively, no such thing in Scripture as a promiscuous
resurrection&mdash;a common rising of all at the same
time. We must abandon this idea altogether, like many
others which we have received to hold, in which we have
been trained from our earliest days, which have grown
with our growth and strengthened with our strength,
until they have become actually ingrained as a part of
our very mental, moral, and religious constitution, so that
to part with them is like the sundering of limb from
limb, or rending the flesh from our bones.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it must be done if we really desire to grow
in the knowledge of divine revelation. There is no
greater hindrance to our getting into the thoughts of
God than having our minds filled with our own thoughts,
or the thoughts of men. Thus, for example, in reference
to the subject of this paper, almost all of us have, at one
time, held the opinion that all will rise together, both believers
and unbelievers, and all stand together to be
judged. Whereas, when we come to Scripture, like a little
child, nothing can be simpler, nothing clearer, nothing
more explicit than its teaching as to this question. Revelation
xx. 5 teaches us that there will be an interval of a
thousand years between the resurrection of the saints and
the resurrection of the wicked.</p>

<p>It is of no use to speak of a resurrection of spirits. Indeed
it is a manifest piece of absurdity; for inasmuch as
spirits cannot die they cannot be raised from the dead.
Equally absurd is it to speak of a resurrection of principles.
There is no such thing in Scripture. The language
is as plain as plainness itself. "The rest of the
dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.
This is the first resurrection." Why should any
one seek to set aside the plain force of such a passage?
Why not bow to it? Why not get rid, at once, of all our
old and fondly cherished notions, and receive with meekness
the engrafted word?</p>

<p>Reader, does it not seem plain to thee that if Scripture
speaks of a <i>first</i> resurrection, then it must follow that all
will not rise together? Why should it be said, "Blessed
and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection," if
all are to rise at the same time?</p>

<p>In fact it seems to us impossible for any unprejudiced
mind to study the New Testament and yet hold to the
theory of a promiscuous resurrection. It is due to the
glory of Christ, the Head, that His members should have
a specific resurrection&mdash;a resurrection like His own&mdash;a
resurrection from among the dead. And verily, so they
shall. "Behold I show you a mystery: we shall not
all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in
the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed. For this corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on
incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,
then shall be brought to pass the saying that is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O, death,
where is thy sting? O, grave, where is thy victory?
The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the
law. But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved
brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding
in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
labor is not in vain in the Lord" (1 Corinthians xv.).</p>

<h3>THE JUDGMENT</h3>

<p>There is something peculiarly painful in the thought
of having so frequently to come in collision with the
generally received opinions of the professing church. It
looks presumptuous to contradict, on so many subjects,
all the great standards and creeds of Christendom. But
what is one to do? Were it indeed a mere question of
human opinion it might seem a piece of bold and unwarrantable
temerity for any one individual to set himself in
direct opposition to the established faith of the whole
professing church&mdash;a faith which has held sway for centuries
over the minds of millions.</p>

<p>But we would ever impress upon our readers the fact
that it is not at all a question of human opinion or of a
difference of judgment amongst even the very best of
men. It is entirely a question as to the teaching and
authority of holy Scripture. There have been, and there
are, and there will be, schools of doctrine, varieties of
opinion, and shades of thought; but it is the obvious
duty of every child of God and every servant of Christ to
bow down in holy reverence, and hearken to the voice
of God in Scripture. If it be merely a matter of human
authority, it must simply go for what it is worth; but,
on the other hand, if it be a matter of divine authority,
then all discussion is closed, and our place&mdash;the place of
all&mdash;is to bow and believe.</p>

<p>Thus, in our last paper we were led to see that there is
no such thing in Scripture as a general resurrection&mdash;a
common rising of all at the same time. We trust our
readers have, like the Bereans of old, searched the Scriptures
as to this, and that they are now prepared to accompany
us in our examination of the word of God as to
the subject of the judgment.</p>

<p>The great question at the outset is this, Does Scripture
teach the doctrine of a general judgment? Christendom
holds it; but does Scripture teach it? Let us see.</p>

<p>In the first place, as to the Christian individually, and
the church of God, collectively, the New Testament sets
forth the precious truth that there is no judgment at all.
So far as the believer is concerned judgment is past and
gone. The heavy cloud of judgment has burst upon the
head of our divine Sin-bearer. He has exhausted, on
our behalf, the cup of wrath and judgment, and planted
us on the new ground of resurrection, to which judgment
can never, by any possibility, apply. It is just as impossible
that a member of the body of Christ can come into
judgment as that the divine Head Himself can do so.
This seems a very strong statement to make; but is it
true? If so, its strength is part of its moral value and
glory.</p>

<p>For what, let us ask, was Jesus judged on the cross?
For His people. He was made sin for us. He represented
us there. He stood in our stead. He bore all
that was due to us. Our entire condition, with all its
belongings, was dealt with in the death of Christ; and so
dealt with that it is utterly impossible that any question
can ever be raised. Has God any question to settle with
Christ, the Head? Clearly not. Well, then, neither has
He any question to settle with the members. Every
question is divinely and definitively settled, and, in proof
of the settlement, the Head is crowned with glory and
honor, and seated at the right hand of the Majesty in the
heavens.</p>

<p>Hence, to suppose that Christians are to come to judgment,
at any time, or on any ground, or for any object
whatsoever, is to deny the very foundation truth of Christianity,
and to contradict the plain words of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who has expressly declared, in reference to
all who believe in Him, that they "shall not come into
judgment" (John v. 24).</p>

<p>In point of fact, the idea of Christians being arraigned
at the bar of judgment to try the question of their title
and fitness for heaven is as absurd as it is unscriptural.
For example, how can we think of Paul or the penitent
thief standing to be judged as to their title to heaven
after having been there already for nearly two thousand
years? But thus it must be if there be any truth in the
theory of a general judgment. If the great question of
our title to heaven has to be settled at the day of judgment,
then clearly it was not settled on the cross; and if
it was not settled on the cross, then most surely we shall
be damned; for if we are to be judged at all it must be
according to our works, and the only possible issue of
such a judgment is the lake of fire.</p>

<p>If, however, it be maintained that Christians shall only
stand in the judgment in order to make it manifest that
they are clear through the death of Christ, then would
the day of judgment be turned into a mere formality, the
bare thought of which is most revolting to every pious
and well regulated mind.</p>

<p>But, in truth, there is no need of reasoning on the
point. One sentence of holy Scripture is better far than
ten thousand of man's most cogent arguments. Our
Lord Christ hath declared, in the clearest and most emphatic
terms, that believers "shall not come into judgment."
This is enough. The believer was judged over
eighteen hundred years ago in the Person of his Head;
and to bring him into judgment again would be to ignore
completely the cross of Christ in its atoning efficacy;
and most assuredly God will not, cannot allow this. The
very feeblest believer may say, in thankfulness and
triumph, "So far as I am concerned, all that had to be
judged is judged already. Every question that had to be
settled is settled. Judgment is past and gone forever.
I know my work must be tried, my service appraised;
but as to myself, my person, my standing, my title, all is
divinely settled. The Man who answered for me on the
tree is now crowned on the throne; and the crown which
He wears is the proof that there remains no judgment for
me. I am waiting for a life resurrection."</p>

<p>This, and nothing short of this, is the proper language
of the Christian. It is simply due to the work of
the cross that the believer should thus feel and thus express
himself. For such a one to be looking forward to
the day of judgment for a settlement of the question of
his eternal destiny is to dishonor his Lord and deny the
efficacy of His atoning sacrifice. It may sound like humility
and savor of piety to hover in doubt. But we
may rest assured that all who harbor doubts, all who live
in a state of uncertainty, all who are looking forward to
the day of judgment for a final settlement of their affairs,
all such are more occupied with themselves than with
Christ. They have not yet understood the application of
the cross to their sins and to their nature. They are
doubting the word of God and the work of Christ, and
this is not Christianity. There is&mdash;there can be&mdash;no
judgment for those who, sheltered by the cross, have
planted a firm foot on the new and everlasting ground of
resurrection. For such all judgment is over forever, and
nothing remains but a prospect of cloudless glory and
everlasting blessedness in the presence of God and of the
Lamb.</p>

<p>However, it is not at all improbable that all this while
the mind of the reader has been recurring to Matthew
xxv. 31-46 as a Scripture which directly establishes the
theory of a general judgment; and we feel it to be our
sacred duty to turn with him for a moment to that very
solemn and important passage; at the same time reminding
him of the fact that no one Scripture can possibly
clash with another, and hence if we read, in John v. 24,
that believers shall not come into judgment, we cannot
read in Matthew xxv. that they shall. This is a fixed and
invulnerable principle&mdash;a general rule to which there is,
and can be, no exception. Nevertheless, let us turn to
Matthew xxv.</p>

<p>"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and
all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the
throne of his glory. And before him shall be gathered
all nations; and he shall separate them one from another,
as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats."</p>

<p>Now, it is most necessary to pay strict attention to the
precise terms made use of in this Scripture. We must
avoid all looseness of thought, all that haste, carelessness,
and inaccuracy which have caused such serious damage
to the teaching of this weighty Scripture, and thrown so
many of the Lord's people into the utmost confusion respecting
it.</p>

<p>And, first of all, let us see who are the parties arraigned.
"Before him shall be gathered <i>all nations</i>." This is very
definite. It is the living nations. It is not a question of
individuals, but of nations&mdash;all the Gentiles. Israel is
not here, for we read in Numbers xxiii. 9, that "the people
shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among
the nations." If Israel were to be included in this scene
of judgment, then would Matthew xxv. stand in palpable
contradiction to Numbers xxiii., which is wholly out of
the question. Israel is never reckoned amongst the Gentiles,
on any ground or for any object whatever. Looked
at from a divine point of view, Israel stands alone. They
may, because of their sins, and under the governmental
dealings of God, be scattered among the nations; but
God's word declares that they shall not be reckoned
among them; and this should suffice for us.</p>

<p>If then it be true that Israel is not included in the
judgment of Matthew xxv. then, without proceeding one
step further, the idea of its being a general judgment
must be abandoned. It cannot be general, if all are not
included; but Israel is never included under the term
"Gentiles." Scripture speaks of three distinct classes,
namely, "The Jew, and the Gentile, and the church of
God," and these three are never confounded. But, further,
we have to remark that the church of God is not included
in the judgment of Matthew xxv. Nor is this
statement based merely upon the fact which has been
already gone into of the church's necessary exemption
from judgment; but also upon the grand truth that the
church is taken from among the nations, as Peter declared
in the council at Jerusalem. "God did visit the Gentiles
to <i>take out of them</i> a people for his name." If then the
church be taken out of the nations, it cannot be reckoned
among them; and thus we have additional evidence
against the theory of a general judgment in Matthew
xxv. The Jew is not there; the church is not there;
and therefore the idea of a general judgment must be
abandoned as something wholly untenable.</p>

<p>Who then are included in this judgment? The passage
itself supplies the answer to any simple mind. It says,
"Before him shall be gathered all <i>nations</i>." This is distinct
and definite. It is not a judgment of individuals,
but of nations, as such. And further, we may add that
not one of those here indicated shall have passed through
the article of death. In this it stands in vivid contrast
with the scene in Revelation xx. 11-15, in the which
there will not be one who has not died. In short, in
Matthew xxv., we have the judgment of "the quick;"
and in Revelation xx. the judgment of "the dead." Both
these are referred to in 2 Timothy iv., "I charge thee before
God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the
quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom."
Our Lord Christ shall judge the living nations at His appearing;
and He shall "judge the dead, small and great,"
at the close of His millennial reign.</p>

<p>But let us glance, for a moment, at the mode in which
the parties are arranged in the judgment, in Matthew
xxv.: "He shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the
goats on the left." Now, the almost universal belief of
the professing church is that "the sheep" represent all
the people of God, from the beginning to the end of
time; and that "the goats," on the other hand, set forth
all the wicked, from first to last. But, if this be so, what
are we to make of the third party referred to here, under
the title of "these my brethren?" The King addresses
both the sheep and the goats in respect to this third class.
Indeed the very ground of judgment is the treatment of
the King's brethren. It would involve a manifest absurdity
to say that the sheep were themselves the parties referred
to. If that were so the language would be wholly
different, and in place of saying, "Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these my brethren" we
should hear the King saying, "Inasmuch as ye have done
it to one another," or, "amongst yourselves."</p>

<p>We would beg the reader's special attention to this
point. We consider that were there no other argument
and no other Scripture on the subject, this one point
would prove fatal to the theory of a general judgment.
It is impossible not to see three parties in the scene,
namely, "the sheep," and "the goats," and "these my
brethren;" and if there are three parties it cannot possibly
be a general judgment, inasmuch as "these my brethren"
are not included either in the sheep or the goats.</p>

<p>No, dear reader, it is not a general judgment at all, but
a very partial and specific one. It is a judgment of living
nations, previous to the opening of the millennial
kingdom. Scripture teaches us that after the church has
left the earth a testimony will go forth to the nations;
the gospel of the kingdom shall be borne, by Jewish messengers,
far and wide, over the earth, into those regions
which are wrapped in heathen darkness. These nations
which shall receive the messengers and treat them kindly
will be found on the King's right hand. Those, on the
contrary, who shall reject them and treat them unkindly
will be found on His left. "These my brethren" are
Jews&mdash;the brethren of the Messiah.</p>

<p>The treatment of the Jews is the ground on which the
nations will be judged by-and-by; and this is another
argument against a general judgment. We know full
well that all those who have lived and died in the rejection
of the gospel of Christ will have something more to
answer for than unkindness to the King's brethren. And,
on the other hand, those who shall surround the Lamb in
heavenly glory will do so on a very different title from
aught that their works can furnish.</p>

<p>In short, there is not a single feature in the scene, not
a single fact in the history, not a single point in the narrative
which does not make against the notion of a general
judgment. And not only so, but the more we study
Scripture, the more we know of the ways of God; the
more we know of His nature, His character, His purposes,
His counsels, His thoughts; the more we know of
Christ, His person, His work, His glory; the more we
know of the church, its standing before God in Christ, its
completeness, its perfect acceptance in Christ; the more
closely we study Scripture; the more profoundly we meditate
therein&mdash;the more thoroughly convinced we must be
that there can be no such thing as a general judgment.</p>

<p>Who that knows aught of God could suppose that He
would justify His people to-day and arraign them in judgment
to-morrow&mdash;that He would blot out their transgressions
to-day and judge them according to their works
to-morrow? Who that knows aught of our adorable
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ could suppose that He
would ever arraign His church, His body, His bride, before
the judgment seat in company with all those who
have died in their sins? Could it be possible that He
would enter into judgment with His people for sins and
iniquities of which He has said, "I will remember no
more!"</p>

<p>But enough. We fondly trust that the reader is now
most fully persuaded in his own mind that there is, and
can be, no such thing as a promiscuous resurrection&mdash;no
such thing as a general judgment.</p>

<p>We cannot now enter upon the judgment in Rev. xx.
11-15 further than to say that it is a post-millennial scene,
and that it includes all the wicked dead, from the days of
Cain down to the last apostate from millennial glory.
There will not be one there who has not passed through
the article of death&mdash;not one there whose name has been
set down in life's fair book&mdash;not one there who shall not
be judged according to his own very deeds&mdash;not one there
who shall not pass from the dread realities of the great
white throne into the everlasting horrors and ineffable
torments of the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.
How awful! How terrible! How perfectly dreadful!</p>

<p>O! reader, what sayest thou to these things? Art thou
a true believer in Jesus? Art thou washed in His precious
blood? Art thou sheltered in Him from coming
judgment? If not, let me entreat thee now, with all tenderness
and earnestness, to flee, this very hour, from the
wrath to come! Flee to Jesus, who now waits to receive
thee to His loving bosom, and to present you to God in
the full value of His atoning work, and in the full credit
of His peerless name.</p>

<h3>THE JEWISH REMNANT</h3>

<p>We must ask the reader to open his Bible and read
Matt. xxiv. 1-44. It forms a part of one of the most profound
and comprehensive discourses that ever fell on
human ears&mdash;a discourse which takes in, in its marvellous
sweep, the destiny of the Jewish remnant; the history
of Christendom; and the judgment of the nations. At
the last-named subject we have already glanced. It remains
for us now to consider the subject of the remnant
of Israel, and the history of professing Christianity,
whether genuine or spurious.</p>

<p>And, first, let us look at the Jewish remnant.</p>

<p>In order to understand Matt. xxiv. 1-44, it will be
needful for us to place ourselves at the standpoint of
those whom our Lord was addressing at the moment. If
we attempt to import into this discourse the light which
shines in the Epistle to the Ephesians, we shall only involve
our minds in confusion, and miss the solemn teaching
of the passage which now lies open before us. We
shall find nothing about the church of God, the body of
Christ, here. The teaching of our Lord is divinely perfect,
and hence we cannot, for a moment, imagine anything
premature therein. But it would be premature to
have introduced a subject which, as yet, was hid in God.
The great truth of the church could not be unfolded until
Christ, being cut off as the Messiah, had taken His place
at the right hand of God, and sent down the Holy Ghost,
to form by His presence the one body, composed of Jew
and Gentile.</p>

<p>Of this we hear nothing in Matt. xxiv. We are entirely
on Jewish ground, surrounded by Jewish circumstances
and influences. The scenery and the allusions are all
purely Jewish. To attempt to apply the passage to the
church would be to miss completely our Lord's object,
and to falsify the real position of the church of God.
The more closely we examine the Scripture, the more
clearly we shall see that the persons addressed occupy a
Jewish standpoint, and are on Jewish ground, whether
we think of those very persons whom our Lord was then
addressing, or those who shall occupy the self-same
ground at the close, when the church shall have left the
scene altogether.</p>

<p>Let us examine the passage.</p>

<p>At the close of Matt, xxiii., our Lord sums up His appeal
to the leaders of the Jewish nation with the following
words of awful solemnity: "Fill ye up then the measure
of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers!
how can ye escape the damnation of hell? Wherefore,
behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and
some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and
persecute them from city to city. That upon you may
come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from
the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zecharias,
son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and
the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall
come <i>upon this generation</i>. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou
that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent
unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children
together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left
unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see
me henceforth till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh
in the name of the Lord" (verses 32-39).</p>

<p>Thus closes Messiah's testimony to the apostate nation
of Israel. Every effort that love, even divine love, could
put forth had been tried, and tried in vain. Prophets
had been sent, and stoned; messenger after messenger
had gone and pleaded, and reasoned, and warned, and
entreated; but to no purpose. Their mighty words had
fallen upon deaf ears and hardened hearts. The only return
made to all these messengers was shameful handling,
stoning, and death.</p>

<p>At length, the Son Himself was sent, and sent with this
touching utterance: "It may be they will reverence my
Son, when they see him." Did they? Alas! no. When
they saw Him, there was no beauty that they should desire
Him. The daughter of Zion had no heart for her
King. The vineyard was under the control of wicked
husbandmen who wanted to keep it for themselves.
"The husbandmen said among themselves, This is the
heir, come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be
ours."</p>

<p>Thus much as to the moral condition of Israel, in view
of which our Lord spoke those unusually awful words
quoted above; and, then, "He went out and departed
from the temple." How reluctant he was to do this we
know; for, blessed be His name, whenever He leaves a
place of mercy, or enters a place of judgment, He moves
with a slow and measured pace. Witness the departure
of the glory, in the opening chapters of Ezekiel. "Then
the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of
the house, and stood over the cherubims. And the
cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from
the earth in my sight; when they went out, the wheels
also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of
the east gate of the Lord's house; and the glory of the
God of Israel was over them above" (chap. x. 18, 19).
"Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the
wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel
was over them above. And the glory of the Lord went
up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain
which is on the east side of the city" (chap. xi. 22, 23).</p>

<p>Thus, with slow and measured pace, did the glory of
the God of Israel take its departure from the house at
Jerusalem. Jehovah lingered near the spot, reluctant to
depart.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He had come, with loving alacrity, with His
whole heart and with His whole soul, to dwell in the
midst of His people, to find a home in the very bosom of
His assembly; but He was <i>forced</i> away by their sins and
iniquities. He would fain have remained; but it was impossible;
and yet He proved, by the very mode of His
departure, how unwilling He was to go.</p>

<p>Nor was it otherwise with Jehovah Messiah, in Matt.
xxiii. Witness His touching words, "How often would
I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen
gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
not!" Here lay the deep secret. "I <i>would</i>." This was
the heart of God. "<i>Ye would not.</i>" This was the heart
of Israel. He, too, like the glory in the days of Ezekiel,
was forced away; but not, blessed be His name, without
dropping a word which forms the precious basis of hope
as to the brighter days to come, when the glory shall return,
and the daughter of Zion shall welcome her King
with joyful accents. "Blessed is he that cometh in the
name of Jehovah."</p>

<p>But, until that bright day dawn, darkness, desolation,
and ruin, make up the sum of Israel's history. The very
thing which the leaders sought, by the rejection of Christ,
to avert, came upon them, in stern and awful reality.
"The Romans shall come, and take away both our place
and nation" How literally, how solemnly this was fulfilled!
Alas! their place and their nation were gone
already, and the significant movement of Jesus, in Matt.
xxiv. 1, was but the passing sentence, and writing desolation
upon the whole Jewish system. "Jesus went out
and departed from the temple." The case was hopeless.
All must be given up. A long period of darkness and
dreariness must pass over the infatuated nation&mdash;a period
which shall culminate in that "great tribulation" which
must precede the hour of final deliverance.</p>

<p>But, as in the days of Ezekiel, there were those who
sighed and cried over the sins and sorrows of the nation,
so in the days of Matt. xxiv. there was a remnant of godly
souls who attached themselves to the rejected Messiah,
and who cherished the fond hope of redemption and restoration
for Israel. Very dim indeed were their perceptions,
and their thoughts full of confusion. Nevertheless
their hearts, as touched by divine grace, beat true to the
Messiah, and they were full of hope as to Israel's future.</p>

<p>Now, it is of the utmost importance that the reader
should recognize and understand the position of this
remnant, and that it is with it our Lord is occupied in
His marvellous discourse on the mount of Olives. To
suppose for a moment that the persons here addressed
were on Christian ground would involve the abandonment
of all true thoughts of what Christianity is, and the ignoring
of a company whose existence is recognized
throughout the Psalms, the Prophets, and various parts
of the New Testament. There was, and there always is,
"a remnant according to the election of grace." To quote
the passages which present the history, the sorrows, the
experiences, and the exercises of that remnant would demand
a volume, and hence we shall not attempt it; but
we are extremely desirous that the reader should seize the
thought that this godly remnant is represented by the
handful of disciples which gathered round our Lord on
the mount of Olives. We feel persuaded that if this be
not seen, the true scope, bearing, and application of this
remarkable discourse must be lost.</p>

<p>"And Jesus went out and departed from the temple;
and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings
of the temple. And Jesus said unto them, See ye
not all these things? Verily I say unto you there shall
not be left one stone upon another that shall not be
thrown down. And as he sat upon the mount of Olives
the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us,
when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign
of thy coming, and of the end of the world" (or age,
&#945;&#953;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;)?</p>

<p>The disciples were, naturally, occupied with earthly and
Jewish objects and expectations&mdash;the temple and its surroundings.
This must be borne in mind if we would understand
their question and our Lord's reply. As yet
they had no thought beyond the earthly side of things.
They looked for the setting up of the kingdom, the glory
of the Messiah, the accomplishment of the promises made
to the fathers. They had not yet fully taken in the solemn
and momentous fact that the Messiah was to be
"cut off and have nothing" (Dan. ix. 26). True, the
blessed Master had, from time to time, sought to prepare
their minds for that solemn event. He had faithfully
warned them in reference to the dark shadows that were
to gather round His path. He had told them that the
Son of Man should be delivered to the Gentiles to be
mocked and scourged and crucified.</p>

<p>But they understood Him not. Such sayings seemed
dark, hard, and incomprehensible; and their hearts still
fondly clung to the hope of national restoration and
blessing. They longed to see the star of Jacob in the
ascendant. Their minds were full of expectancy as to
the restoration of the kingdom to Israel. As yet they
knew nothing&mdash;how could they?&mdash;of that which was to
spring out of the rejection and death of the Messiah.
The Lord had no doubt spoken of building an assembly;
but as to the position and privileges of that assembly, its
calling, its standing, its hopes, they knew absolutely
nothing. The thought of a body composed of Jew and
Gentile, united by the Holy Ghost to a living and glorified
Head in the heavens, had never entered&mdash;how could
it have entered?&mdash;their minds. The middle wall of partition
was still standing; and one of their number&mdash;the
very foremost amongst them&mdash;had, long after, to be
taught, with much difficulty, to take in the idea of even
admitting the Gentiles into the kingdom.</p>

<p>All this, we repeat, must be taken into account, if we
would read aright our Lord's reply to the inquiry as to
His coming and the end of the age. There is not a single
syllable about the church, as such, from beginning to
end of that reply. Up to verse 14, He passes on to the
end, giving a rapid survey of the events which should
transpire amongst the nations. "Take heed," He says,
"that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my
name saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
And ye shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars: see that
ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to
pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall
be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers
places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then
shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's
sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray
one another, and shall hate one another. And many false
prophets shall rise and shall deceive many. And because
iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be
saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then
shall the end come."</p>

<p>Here then we have a most comprehensive sketch of the
entire period from the moment in which our Lord was
speaking, down to the time of the end. But the reader
will need to bear in mind that there is an unnoticed
interval&mdash;a parenthesis, a break&mdash;in this period, during
which the great mystery of the church is unfolded.</p>

<p>This interval or break is entirely passed over in this
discourse, inasmuch as the time had not arrived for its
development. It was as yet "hid in God," and could not
be unfolded until the Messiah was finally rejected and cut
off from the earth and received up into glory. The
entire of this discourse would have its full and perfect
accomplishment, although such a thing as the church had
never been heard of. For, let it never be forgotten, the
church forms no part of the ways of God with Israel and
the earth. And as to the allusion, in verse 14, to the
preaching of the gospel, we are not to suppose that it is
at all the same thing as "The glorious gospel of the grace
of God," as preached by Paul. It is styled, "This gospel
of the kingdom;" and, moreover, it is to be preached,
not for the purpose of gathering the church, but "as a
witness to all nations." We must not confound things
which God, in His infinite wisdom, has made to differ.
The church must not be confounded with the kingdom:
nor yet the gospel of the grace of God with the gospel of
the kingdom. The two things are perfectly distinct;
and, if we confound them, we shall understand neither
the one nor the other. And, further, we would desire to
press upon the reader the absolute necessity of seeing
the break, parenthesis, or unnoticed interval in which the
great mystery of the church is inserted. If this be not
clearly seen, Matt. xxiv. cannot be understood.</p>

<p>But we must proceed with our Lord's discourse.</p>

<p>At verse 15, He seems to call His hearers back a little,
as it were, to something very specific&mdash;something with
which a Jewish believer would be familiar from the fact of
Daniel's allusion to it. "When ye, therefore, shall see
the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the
prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso readeth let him
understand): then let them which be in Judea flee into
the mountains. Let him which is on the housetop not
come down to take anything out of his house: neither let
him which is in the field return back to take his clothes....
But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,
neither on the Sabbath day. For then shall be great
tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the
world to this time, no, nor ever shall be."</p>

<p>All this is most definite. The quotation from Daniel
xii. fixes the application beyond all question. It proves
that the reference is not to the siege of Jerusalem, under
Titus; for we read in Daniel xii. that, "At that time thy
people shall be delivered;" and, most clearly, they were
not delivered in the days of Titus. No; the reference is
to the time of the end. The scene is laid at Jerusalem.
The persons addressed and contemplated are Jewish believers&mdash;the
pious remnant of Israel, in the great tribulation,
after the church has left the scene. How can any
imagine that the persons here instructed are viewed as on
church ground? What force would there be to such in
the allusion to the winter or the Sabbath day?</p>

<p>Then, again, "If any man shall say unto you, Lo,
here is Christ, or there, believe it not.... If they
shall say unto you, Behold he is in the desert, go not
forth: Behold he is in the secret chambers, believe it
not." What possible application could such words have
to persons who are instructed to wait for God's Son from
heaven, and who know that ere He returns to this earth
they shall have met Him in the clouds and returned with
Him to the Father's house? Could any Christian, instructed
in his proper hope, be deceived by persons saying
that Christ is here or there, in the desert or in the
secret chambers? Impossible. Such a one is looking
out for the Bridegroom to come from heaven; and he
knows that it is wholly out of the question that Christ
can appear on this earth without bringing all His people
with Him.</p>

<p>Thus, the simple truth settles everything; and all we
want is to be simple in taking it in. The simplest Christian
knows full well that his Lord will not appear to him
like a flash of lightning, but as the bright and morning
Star, and hence he understands that Matt. xxiv. cannot
apply to the church, though most surely the church can
study it with interest and profit, as it can all the other
prophetic Scriptures; and, we may add, the interest will
be all the more intense, and the profit all the deeper, in
proportion as we see the true application of such Scriptures.</p>

<p>Limited space forbids our entering as fully as we could
wish into the remaining portion of this marvellous discourse;
but the more closely each sentence is examined,
the more fully each circumstance is weighed, the more
clearly we must see that the persons addressed are not on
proper Christian ground. The entire scene is earthly
and Jewish, not heavenly and Christian. There is ample
instruction supplied for those who shall find themselves,
by-and-by, in the position here contemplated; and nothing
can be clearer than that the entire paragraph, from
verse 15-42, refers to the period which shall elapse between
the rapture of the saints and the appearing of the
Son of Man.</p>

<p>Some may perhaps feel a difficulty in understanding
verse 34: "This generation shall not pass till all these
things be fulfilled." But we must remember that the
word "generation" is constantly used in Scripture in a
moral sense. It is not to be confined to a certain number
of persons actually living at the time, but takes in
the <i>race</i>. In the passage before us it simply applies to
the Jewish race; but the wording is such as to leave the
question of time entirely open, so that the heart might
ever be kept in readiness for the Lord's coming. There
is nothing in Scripture to interfere with the constant expectation
of that grand event. On the contrary, every
parable, every figure, every allusion is so worded as to
warrant each one to look for the Lord's return in his own
lifetime, and yet to leave margin for the elongation of the
time according to the long-suffering grace of a Saviour
God.</p>

<h3>CHRISTENDOM</h3>

<p>What varied thoughts and feelings are awakened in
the soul by the very sound of the word "Christendom!"
It is a terrible word. It brings before us, at once, that
vast mass of baptized profession which calls itself the
church of God, but is not; which calls itself Christianity,
but is not. Christendom is dark and a dreadful anomaly.
It is neither one thing nor the other. It is not "the Jew
or the Gentile, or the church of God." It is a corrupt
mysterious mixture, a spiritual malformation, the masterpiece
of Satan, the corrupter of the truth of God, and the
destroyer of the souls of men, a trap, a snare, a stumbling-block,
the darkest moral blot in the universe of God. It
is the corruption of the very best thing, and therefore the
very worst of corruptions. It is that thing which Satan
has made of professing Christianity. It is worse, by far,
than Judaism; worse by far than all the darkest forms
of Paganism, because it has higher light and richer privileges,
makes the very highest profession, and occupies
the very loftiest platform. Finally, it is that awful apostasy
for which is reserved the very heaviest judgments or
God&mdash;the most bitter dregs in the cup of His righteous
wrath.</p>

<p>True it is, blessed be God, there are a few names even
in Chistendom who, through grace, have not denied their
garments. There are some brilliant embers amid the
smouldering ashes&mdash;precious stones amid the terrible
<i>débris</i>. But as to the mass of Christian profession to
which the term Christendom applies, nothing can be
more appalling, whether we think of its present condition
or its future destiny. We doubt if Christians generally
have anything like an adequate sense of the true character
and inevitable doom of that which surrounds them.
If they had it would solemnize their minds, and cause
them to feel the urgent need of standing apart, in holy
separation, from Christendom's ways, and distinct testimony
against its spirit and principles.</p>

<p>But let us turn again to our Lord's profound discourse
on the mount of Olives, in which, as we have already observed,
He deals with the subject of the Christian profession.
This He does in three distinct parables, namely,
the household servant; the ten virgins; and the talents.
In each and all we have the two things noticed above,
the genuine and the spurious; the true and the false;
the bright and the dark; that which is of Christ, and
that which is of Satan; that which belongs to heaven and
that which emanates from hell.</p>

<p>We shall glance at the three parables which embody, in
their brief compass, a vast mine of most solemn and practical
instruction.</p>

<p>Turn to Matt. xxiv. 45-47. "Who, then, is a faithful
and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his
household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is
that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh shall find
so doing. Verily I say unto you that he shall make him
ruler over all his goods."</p>

<p>Here, then, we have at once the source and object of
all ministry in the house of God. "Whom <i>his lord</i> hath
made ruler." This is the source. "To give them meat
in due season." This is the object.</p>

<p>These things are of the very highest possible moment,
and they are worthy of the reader's most profound
thought. All ministry in the house of God, whether in
old or New Testament times, is of divine appointment.
There is no such thing recognized in Scripture as human
authority in appointing to the ministry. Neither is there
such a thing as a self-constituted ministry. None but
God can make or appoint a minister of any sort or description.
Thus, in Old Testament times, Jehovah appointed
Aaron and his sons to the priesthood; and if a
stranger presumed to meddle with the functions of the
holy office, he was to be put to death. Even the king
himself dared not touch the priestly censer, for we are
told of Uzziah, king of Judah, that, "When he was
strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction; for he
transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the
temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
And Azariah the priest went in after him, and
with him fourscore priests of the Lord, that were valiant
men. And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said
unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn
incense unto the Lord, but to the priests the sons of
Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense; go out of
the sanctuary: for thou hast trespassed: neither shall it
be for thine honor from the Lord God.... <i>And
Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death</i>" (2
Chron. xxvi.).</p>

<p>Such was the solemn result&mdash;the awful consequence of
man's daring intrusion upon that which was wholly of
divine appointment. Has this no voice for Christendom?
Assuredly it has. It sounds a warning note in our ears.
It tells the professing church, in accents not to be mistaken,
to beware of human intrusion upon a domain
which belongs only to God. "Every high priest taken
from among men is ordained <i>for</i> [not <i>by</i>] men in things
pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
for sins.... And <i>no man taketh this honor unto
himself</i>, but he that is called [not of men but] of God, as
was Aaron."</p>

<p>Nor was this principle of divine appointment confined
to the high and holy office of the tabernacle. No man
dare put his hand to the most insignificant part of that
sacred structure unless by Jehovah's direct authority.
"The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, See <i>I have called</i>
by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the
tribe of Judah." Nor could Bezaleel choose his companions
in labor, or appoint whom he would to the work,
any more than he could choose or appoint himself. No;
this, too, was divine. "And I," says Jehovah, "behold
<i>I have given</i> with him Aholiab." Thus Aholiab, as well as
Bezaleel, held his commission immediately from Jehovah
Himself, the only true source of all ministerial authority.</p>

<p>Nor was it otherwise in the case of the prophetic office
and ministry. God alone could make, and fit, and send
a prophet. Alas! there were those of whom Jehovah had
to say, "I have not sent them, yet they ran." They
were unhallowed intruders upon the domain of prophecy,
just as there were upon the office of the priesthood; but
all such brought down upon themselves the judgment of
God.</p>

<p>And, may we not ask, Is this great principle changed
now? Has ministry been shifted from its ancient base?
Has the living stream been diverted from its divine
source? Is it true that this more precious and glorious
institution has been shorn of its lofty dignities? Can it
be possible that, under the times of the New Testament,
ministry has been cast down from its divine excellency?
Has it become a mere human appointment? Can man
appoint his fellow, or appoint himself to any one branch
of ministry in the house of God?</p>

<p>What answer is to be returned to these questions? No
doubtful one, thank God; but a distinct and emphatic
<i>No!</i> Ministry was, is, and ever shall be, divine; divine
in its source; divine in its nature; divine in its every
feature and principle. "There are diversities of gifts,
but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations,
but the same Lord. And there are diversities
of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in
all" (1 Cor. xii. 4-6). "But now hath <i>God</i> set the members
every one of them in the body <i>as it hath pleased
him</i>." "And <i>God</i> hath set some in the church; first,
apostles; secondarily prophets; thirdly, teachers; after
that, miracles; then gifts of healing, helps, governments,
diversities of tongues" (verses 18, 28). "But unto every
one of us is given grace according to the measure of the
gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up
on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto
men.... And he gave some, apostles; and some,
prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and
teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of
the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ; till
we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Eph. iv.
7-13).</p>

<p>Here lies the grand source of all ministry in the church
of God, from first to last&mdash;from the foundation laid in
grace, to the topstone, in glory. It is divine and heavenly,
not human or earthly. It is not of man or by man,
but of Jesus Christ, and God the Father who raised Him
from the dead, and in the power of the Holy Ghost (see
Gal. i.). There is no such thing recognized in Scripture
as human authority in any one branch of ministry in the
church. If it be a question of gift, it is emphatically
stated to be "the gift of Christ." If it be a question of
assigned position, we are, with equal clearness and emphasis,
told that "God hath set the members." If it be
a question of local charge, whether elder or deacon, it was
entirely of divine appointment, by apostolic hands or
apostolic delegates.</p>

<p>All this is so clear, so distinct, so palpable, on the very
surface of Scripture, that it is only necessary to say,
"How readest thou?" And the more we penetrate beneath
the surface&mdash;the more we are conducted by the
Eternal Spirit into the profound and precious depths of
inspiration&mdash;the more thoroughly convinced we shall be
that ministry, in its every department and every branch,
is divine in its source, nature, and principles. The truth
of this shines out in full-orbed brightness, in the Epistles;
but we have the germ of it in the words of our Lord in
Matt. xxv. 45, "Whom his lord hath made ruler over his
household." The household belongs to the Lord, and He
alone can appoint the servants, and this He does according
to His own sovereign will.</p>

<p>Equally plain is the object of ministry, as stated in this
parable, and elaborated in the Epistles. "To give them
meat in due season." "For the edifying of the body of
Christ"&mdash;"that the church may receive edifying." It is
this that lies near the loving heart of Jesus. He would
have His household perfected&mdash;His church edified&mdash;His
body nourished and cherished. For this end, He bestows
gifts, and maintains them in the church, and will maintain
them until they shall be no longer needed.</p>

<p>But alas! alas! there is a dark side of the picture.
For this we must be prepared since we have the picture
of Christendom before us. If there is a "faithful, wise,
and blessed servant," there is also "an evil servant"
who "says in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming."
Mark this. It is in <i>the heart</i> of the wicked servant that
the thought originates as to the delay of the coming.</p>

<p>And what is the result? "He shall begin to smite his
fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken."
How awfully this has been exemplified in the history of
Christendom, we need not say. Instead of true ministry
flowing from the risen and glorified Head in the heavens,
and promoting the edification of the body, the blessing
of souls, and the prosperity of the household, we have a
false clerical authority, arbitrary rule, a lording it over
God's heritage, a grasping after this world's wealth and
power, fleshly ease, self-indulgence, and personal aggrandizement,
priestly domination in its nameless and numberless
forms and practical consequences.</p>

<p>The reader will do well to apply his heart to the understanding
of these things. He will need to seize, with
clearness and power, the distinction between clericalism
and ministry. The one is a thoroughly human assumption;
the other, a purely divine institution. The former
has its source in man's evil heart; the latter has its
source in a risen and exulted Saviour, who, being raised
from the dead, received gifts for men, and sheds them forth
upon His church, according to His own will. That is a
positive scourge and curse; this, a divine blessing to men.
In fine, this in its root-principle, flows from heaven and
leads back thither; that in its root-principle flows from
hell and leads thither again.</p>

<p>All this is most solemn, and it should exert a mighty
influence upon our souls. There is a day coming when
the Lord Christ will deal, in summary justice, with
that which man has dared to set up in His house. We
speak not of individuals&mdash;though surely it is a most
serious and terrible thing for any one to put his hand unto,
or have aught to do with, that on which such awful judgment
is about to be executed&mdash;but we speak of a positive
system&mdash;a great principle which runs, in a deep and dark
current, through the length and breadth of the professing
church&mdash;we speak of clericalism and priestcraft, in all its
forms and in all its ramifications.</p>

<p>Against this dreadful thing we solemnly warn our readers.
No human language can possibly depict the evil of
it, nor can human language adequately set forth the deep
blessedness of all true ministry in the church of God.
The Lord Jesus not only bestows ministerial gifts, but, in
His marvellous grace, He will abundantly reward the
faithful and diligent exercise of those gifts. But as to
that which man has set up, we read its destiny in those
burning words, "The lord of that servant shall come in a
day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he
is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint
him his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth."</p>

<p>May the gracious Lord deliver His servants and His
people from all participation in this great wickedness
which is perpetrated in the very bosom of that which
calls itself the church of God. And, on the other hand,
may He lead them to understand, to appreciate, and to
exercise that true, that precious, that divine ministry
which emanates from Himself, and is designed, in His
infinite love, for the true blessing and growth of that
church which is so dear to His heart. We are in danger,
very great danger, while seeking (as we most surely
should) to keep clear of the evil of clericalism&mdash;of rushing
into the opposite extreme of despising ministry.</p>

<p>This must be carefully guarded against. We have ever
to bear in mind that ministry in the church is of God.
Its source is divine. Its nature is heavenly and spiritual.
Its object is the calling out, the building up of the church
of God. Our Lord Christ imparts the varied gifts, evangelists,
pastors, and teachers. He holds the great reservoir
of spiritual gifts. He has never given it up, and He
never will. Spite of all that Satan has wrought in the
professing church; spite of all the actings of "that evil
servant;" spite of all man's daring assumption of authority
which in no wise belongs to him; spite of all these
things, our risen and glorified Lord "hath the seven
stars." He possesses all ministerial gift, power, and
authority. It is He alone who can make any one a minister.
Unless He impart a gift there can be no true ministry.
There may be hollow assumption&mdash;guilty usurpation&mdash;empty
affectation&mdash;worthless talking; but not one
atom of true, loving, divine ministry can there be unless
where our sovereign Lord is pleased to bestow the gift.
And even where He does bestow the gift that gift must
be "stirred up," and diligently cultivated, else "the
profiting" will not "appear unto all." The gift must be
exercised in the power of the Holy Ghost, else it will not
promote the divinely appointed end.</p>

<p>But we are rather anticipating what is yet to come before
us in the parable of the talents, so we shall close here
by simply reminding the reader that the weighty subject
on which we have been dwelling has direct reference to
the coming of our Lord, inasmuch as all true ministry is
carried on in view of that great and glorious event. And
not only so, but the counterfeit, the corrupt, the evil
thing will be judicially dealt with when the Lord Christ
shall appear in His glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81k" id="Page_81k">&nbsp;</a></span></p>
<h3>THE TEN VIRGINS</h3>

<p>We now approach that solemn section of our Lord's discourse
in which He presents the kingdom of heaven under
the similitude of "Ten Virgins." The instruction contained
in this most weighty and interesting parable is of
wider application than that of the servant to which we
have already referred, inasmuch as it takes in the whole
range of Christian profession, and is not confined to ministry
either within the house or outside. It bears directly
and pointedly upon Christian profession, whether true or
false.</p>

<p>"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto
ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to
meet the bridegroom." Some have considered that this
parable refers to the Jewish remnant; but it does not
seem that this idea is borne out, either by the context in
which this parable occurs or by the terms in which it is
couched.</p>

<p>As to the entire context, the more closely we examine
it the more clearly we shall see that the Jewish portion of
the discourse ends with chapter xxiv. 44. This is so distinct
as not to admit of a question. Equally distinct is
the Christian portion, extending, as we have seen, from
chapter xxiv. 45 to chapter xxv. 30; while from xxv.
31 to the end, we have the Gentiles. Thus the order and
fulness of this marvellous discourse must strike any
thoughtful reader. It presents the Jew, the Christian,
and the Gentile, each on his own distinct ground, and
according to his own distinctive principles. There is no
merging of one thing in another, no confounding of
things that differ. In a word, the order, the fulness, and
the comprehensiveness of this profound discourse are
divine, and fill the soul "with wonder, love, and praise."
We rise from the study of it, as a whole, with those words
of the apostle upon our lips, "O, the depth of the riches
both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable
are his judgments, and his ways past finding out."</p>

<p>And then, when we examine the precise terms made use
of by our Lord in the parable of the ten virgins we must
see that it applies not to Jews but to Christian professors&mdash;it
applies to us&mdash;it utters a voice, and teaches a solemn
lesson to the writer and the reader of these lines.</p>

<p>Let us apply our hearts thereto.</p>

<p>"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto
ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to
meet the bridegroom."</p>

<p>Primitive Christianity was especially characterized by
the fact here indicated, namely, a going forth to meet a
returning and an expected bridegroom. The early Christians
were led to detach themselves from present things,
and go forth, in the spirit of their minds, and in the
affections of their hearts, to meet the Saviour whom they
loved, and for whom they waited. It was not, of course,
a question of going forth from one place to another; it
was not local, but moral, and spiritual. It was the outgoing
of the heart after a beloved Saviour whose return
was eagerly looked for day by day.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read the epistles to the various
churches and not see that the hope of the Lord's sure and
speedy return governed the hearts of the Lord's dear people
in early days. "They waited for the Son from
heaven." They knew He was to come and take them
away, to be with Himself forever; and the knowledge
and power of this hope had the effect of detaching their
hearts from present things. Their bright, heavenly hope
caused them to sit loose to the things of earth. "They
looked for the Saviour." They believed that He might
come at any moment, and hence the concerns of this life
were just to be taken up and attended to for the moment&mdash;properly,
thoroughly attended to, no doubt&mdash;but only, as
it were, on the very tip-toe of expectation.</p>

<p>All this is conveyed to our hearts, briefly but clearly,
by the expression, "They went forth to meet the bridegroom."
This could not be intelligently applied to the
Jewish remnant, inasmuch as they will not go forth to
meet their Messiah, but, on the contrary, they will remain
in their position and amid their circumstances until
He come and plant His foot on the mount of Olives.
They will not look for the Lord to come and take them
away from this earth to be with Him in heaven; but He
will come to bring deliverance to them in their own land,
and make them happy there under His own peaceful and
blessed reign during the millennial age.</p>

<p>But the call to Christians was to "go forth." They are
supposed to be always on the move; not settling down
on the earth, but going out in earnest and holy aspirations
after that heavenly glory to which they are called,
and after the heavenly Bridegroom to whom they are
espoused, and for whose speedy advent they are taught to
wait.</p>

<p>Such is the true, the divine, the normal idea of the
Christian's attitude and state. And this lovely idea was
marvellously realized and practically carried out by the
primitive Christians. But alas! alas! we are reminded
of the fact that we have to do with the spurious as well
as the true in Christendom. There are "tares" as well
as "wheat" in the kingdom of heaven; and thus we read
of these ten virgins, that "five of them were wise, and
five were foolish." There are the true and the false, the
genuine and the counterfeit, the real and the hollow, in
professing Christianity.</p>

<p>Yes, and this is to continue unto the time of the end,
until the Bridegroom come. The tares are not converted
into wheat, nor are the foolish virgins converted into wise
ones. No, never. The tares will be burnt and the foolish
virgins shut out. So far from a gradual improvement by
the means now in operation&mdash;the preaching of the gospel
and the various beneficent agencies which are brought to
bear upon the world&mdash;we find, from all the parables, and
from the teaching of the entire New Testament, that the
kingdom of heaven presents a most deplorable admixture
of evil; a corrupting process; a grievous tampering with
the work of God, on the part of the enemy; a positive
progress of evil in principle, in profession, and in practice.</p>

<p>And all this goes on to the end. There are foolish
virgins found when the Bridegroom appears. Whence
come they if all are to be converted before the Lord
comes? If all are to be brought to the knowledge of the
Lord by the means now in operation, then how comes it
to pass that when the Bridegroom comes, there are quite
as many foolish as wise?</p>

<p>But it will perhaps be said that this is but a parable, a
figure. Granted; but a figure of what? Not surely of a
whole world converted. To assert this would be to offer
a grievous insult to the holy volume, and to treat our
Lord's solemn teaching in a manner in which we would
not dare to treat the teaching of a fellow mortal.</p>

<p>No, reader, the parable of the ten virgins teaches, beyond
all question, that when the Bridegroom comes,
there will be foolish virgins on the scene, and, clearly, if
there are foolish virgins, all cannot have been previously
converted. A child can understand this. We cannot see
how it is possible, in the face of even this one parable, to
maintain the theory of a world converted before the
coming of the Bridegroom.</p>

<p>But let us look a little closely at these foolish virgins.
Their history is full of admonition for all Christian professors.
It is very brief, but awfully comprehensive.
"They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no
oil with them." There is the outward profession, but no
inward reality&mdash;no spiritual life&mdash;no unction&mdash;no vital
link with the source of eternal life&mdash;no union with Christ.
There is nothing but the lamp of profession, and the dry
wick of a nominal, notional, head belief.</p>

<p>This is peculiarly solemn. It bears down with tremendous
weight upon that vast mass of baptized profession
which surrounds us, at the present moment, in which
there is so much of outward semblance, but so little of
inward reality. All profess to be Christians. The lamp
of profession may be seen in every hand; but ah! how
few have the oil in their vessels, the spirit of life in Christ
Jesus, the Holy Ghost dwelling in their hearts. Without
this, all is utterly worthless and vain. There may be the
vary highest profession; there may be a most orthodox
creed; one may be baptized; he may receive the Lord's
supper; be a regularly enrolled and duly recognized
member of a Christian community; be a Sunday-school
teacher; an ordained minister of religion; one may be all
this, and not have one spark of divine life, not one ray of
heavenly light, not one link with the Christ of God.</p>

<p>Now there is something peculiarly awful in the thought
of having just enough religion to deceive the heart,
deaden the conscience, and ruin the soul&mdash;just enough
religion to give a name to live while dead&mdash;enough to
leave one without Christ, without God, and without hope
in the world&mdash;enough to prop the soul up with a false
confidence, and fill it with a false peace, until the Bridegroom
come, and then the eyes are opened when it is too
late.</p>

<p>Thus it is with the foolish virgins. They seem to be
very like the wise ones. An ordinary observer might not
be able to see any difference, for the time being. They
all set out together. All have lamps. And, moreover, all
turn aside to slumber and sleep, the wise as well as the
foolish. All rouse up at the midnight cry, and trim their
lamps. Thus far there is no apparent difference. The
foolish virgins light their lamps&mdash;the lamp of profession
lighted up with the dry wick of a lifeless, notional, nominal
faith; alas! alas! a worthless&mdash;worse than worthless&mdash;thing,
a fatal soul-destroying delusion.</p>

<p>But here the grand distinction&mdash;the broad line of demarcation&mdash;comes
out with awful, yea, with appalling
clearness. "The foolish said unto the wise, Give us of
your oil; for our lamps <i>are going out</i>" (see margin).
This proves that their lamps had been lighted; for had
they not been lighted, they could not go out. But it was
only a false, flickering, transient light. It was not fed
from a divine source. It was the light of mere lip profession,
fed by a head belief, lasting just long enough to deceive
themselves and others, and going out at the very
moment when they most needed it, leaving them in the
dreadful darkness of eternal night.</p>

<p>"Our lamps are going out." Terrible discovery!
"The Bridegroom is at hand, and our lamps are going
out. Our hollow profession is being made manifest by
the light of His coming. We thought we were all right.
We professed the same faith, had the same shaped lamp,
the same kind of wick; but alas! we now find to our unspeakable
horror, that we have been deceiving ourselves,
that we lack the one thing needful, the spirit of life in
Christ, the unction from the Holy One, the living link
with the Bridegroom. Whatever shall we do? O ye
wise virgins, take pity upon us, and share with us your
oil. Do, do, for mercy's sake, give us a little, even one
drop of that all-essential thing, that we may not perish
forever."</p>

<p>Ah! it is all utterly vain. No one can give of his oil to
another. Each has just enough for himself. Moreover,
it can only be had from God Himself. A man can give
<i>light</i>, but he cannot give <i>oil</i>. This latter is the gift of
God alone. "The wise answered, saying, Not so; lest
there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to
them that sell and buy for yourselves. And while they
went to buy, the Bridegroom came; and they that were
ready went in with him to the marriage; <i>and the door
was shut</i>." It is of no use looking to Christian friends to
help us or prop us up. No use in flying hither and
thither for some one to lean upon&mdash;some holy man, or
some eminent teacher&mdash;no use building upon our church,
or our creed, or our sacraments. <i>We want oil.</i> We cannot
do without it. Where are we to get it? Not from
man, not from the church, not from the saints, not from
the fathers. We must get it from God; and He, blessed
be His name, gives freely. "The gift of God is eternal
life, through Jesus Christ our Lord."</p>

<p>But, mark, it is an individual thing. Each must have
it for himself. No man can believe, or get life for another.
Each must have to do with God for himself. The
link which connects the soul with Christ is intensely individual.
There is no such thing as second-hand faith.
A man may teach us religion, or theology, or the letter of
Scripture; but he cannot give us oil; he cannot give us
faith; he cannot give us life. "It is the <i>gift</i> of God."
Precious little word, "gift." It is like God. It is free
as God's air; free as His sunlight; free as His refreshing
dew-drops. But, we repeat, and with solemn emphasis,
each one must get it for himself, and have it in himself.
"None can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to
God a ransom for him: that he should still live forever
and not see corruption. For the redemption of their soul
is precious, and it ceaseth forever" (Psalm xlix. 7-9).</p>

<p>Reader, what sayest thou to these solemn realities?
Art thou a wise or a foolish virgin? Hast thou gotten
life in a risen and glorified Saviour. Art thou a mere
professor of religion, content with the mere ordinary
dead routine of church-going, having just sufficient religion
to make thee respectable on earth, but not enough
to link thee with heaven?</p>

<p>We earnestly beseech thee to think seriously of these
things. Think of them now. Think how unspeakably
dreadful it will be to find thy lamp of profession going
out and leaving thee in obscure darkness&mdash;darkness that
may be felt&mdash;the outer darkness of an everlasting night.
How terrible to find the door shut behind that brilliant
train which shall go in to the marriage; but shut in thy
face! How agonizing the cry, "Lord, Lord, open unto
us!" How withering, how crushing the response, "I
know you not."</p>

<p>O, beloved friend, do give these weighty matters a
place in thy heart now, while yet the door is open, and
while yet the day of grace is lengthened out in God's
marvellous long suffering. The moment is rapidly approaching
in the which the door of mercy shall be closed
against thee forever, when all hope shall be gone, and
thy precious soul be plunged in black and eternal despair.
May God's spirit rouse thee from thy fatal slumber, and
give thee no rest until thou findest it in the finished work
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and at His blessed feet in adoration
and worship.</p>

<p>We must now draw this paper to a close; but, ere
doing so, we shall just for a moment glance at the wise
virgins. The great distinguishing feature which, according
to the teaching of this parable, marks them off
from the foolish virgins is that when starting at the first
they "took oil in their vessels with their lamps." In
other words, what distinguishes true believers from mere
professors is that the former have in their hearts the
grace of God's Holy Spirit; they have gotten the spirit
of life in Christ Jesus; and the Holy Ghost dwelling in
them as the seal, the earnest, the unction, and the witness.
This grand and glorious fact characterizes now all
true believers in the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;a stupendous,
wondrous fact, most surely&mdash;an immense and ineffable
privilege, which should ever bow our souls in holy adoration
before our God and our Lord Jesus Christ, whose
accomplished redemption has procured for us this great
blessing.</p>

<p>But how sad to think that, notwithstanding this high
and holy privilege, we should have to read, as in the
words of our parable, "They all slumbered and slept!"
All alike, wise as well as foolish, fell asleep. The Bridegroom
tarried, and all, without exception, lost the freshness,
fervor, and power of the hope of His coming, and
fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Such is the statement of our parable, and such is the
solemn fact of the history. The whole professing body
fell asleep. "That blessed hope" which shone so brightly
on the horizon of the early Christians, very speedily
waned and faded away; and as we scan the page of church
history for eighteen centuries, from the Apostolic Fathers
to the opening of the current century, we look in vain for
any intelligent reference to the church's specific hope&mdash;the
personal return of the blessed Bridegroom. In fact,
that hope was virtually lost to the church; nay, more, it
became almost a heresy to teach it. And even now, in
these last days, there are hundreds of thousands of professed
ministers of Christ who dare not preach or teach
the coming of the Lord as it is taught in Scripture.</p>

<p>True it is, blessed be God, we notice a mighty change
within the last half century. There has been a great
awakening. God is, by His Holy Spirit, recalling His
people to long-forgotten truths, and amongst the rest, to
the glorious truth of the coming of the Bridegroom.
Many are now seeing that the reason why the Bridegroom
tarried was simply because God was long-suffering to usward,
not willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance. Precious reason!</p>

<p>But they are also seeing that, spite of this long-suffering,
our Lord is at hand. Christ is coming. The midnight
cry has gone forth, "Behold, the Bridegroom
cometh; go ye out to meet him." May millions of voices
re-echo the soul-stirring cry until it passes in its mighty
moral power, from pole to pole, and from the river to the
ends of the earth, rousing the whole church to wait, as
one man, for the glorious appearing of the blessed Bridegroom
of our hearts.</p>

<p>Brethren beloved in the Lord, awake! awake! Let
every soul be roused. Let us shake off the sloth and the
slumber of worldly ease and self-indulgence&mdash;let us rise
above the withering influence of religious formality and
dull routine&mdash;let us fling aside the dogmas of false theology,
and go forth, in the spirit of our minds and in the
affections of our hearts, to meet our returning Bridegroom.
May His own solemn words come with fresh
power to our souls, "Watch therefore, for ye know neither
the day nor the hour." May the language of our hearts
and our lives be, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus."</p>

<h3>THE TALENTS</h3>

<p>It only remains for us now to consider that portion of
our Lord's discourse in which He again takes up the
deeply solemn subject of ministerial responsibility during
the time of His absence. That this stands closely connected
with the hope of His coming is evident from the
fact that having summed up the parable of the ten virgins
with these most weighty words, "Watch therefore,
for ye know neither the day nor the hour," He goes on
to say, "For as a man travelling into a far country, who
called his servants, and delivered unto them his goods."</p>

<p>There is a material difference between the parable of
the talents and that of the servant in chapter xxiv. 45-51.
In the latter, we have ministry inside the house. In the
former, on the other hand, we have ministry abroad in
the world. But in each we find the grand foundation of
all ministry, namely, the gift and authority of Christ.
"He called <i>His own</i> servants, and delivered unto them
<i>His</i> goods." The servants are His, and the goods are
His. No one but the Lord Christ can put a man into the
ministry, as none but He can impart spiritual gift. It is
utterly impossible for any one to be a minister of Christ
unless He calls him and fits him for the work. This is so
plain as not to admit of a single question. A man may
be a minister of religion; he may preach the doctrines
of the gospel, and teach theology; but a minister of
Christ he cannot possibly be unless Christ calls him to,
and gifts him for, the work. If it be a question of ministry
inside the house, it is "whom his lord hath made
ruler over his house." And if it be a question of ministry
abroad in the world, we are told that "He called his own
servants and delivered unto them his goods."</p>

<p>This great root-principle of ministry is powerfully embodied
in these words of one of the greatest ministers that
ever lived, when he says, "I thank Christ Jesus our
Lord, <i>who hath enabled me</i>, for that he counted me faithful,
<i>putting me into the ministry</i>" (1 Tim. i. 12).</p>

<p>Thus it must be in every case, whatever be the measure,
the character, or the sphere of ministry. The Lord
Christ alone can put any one into the ministry, and
enable him to fulfil it. If it be not this, it will be either
a man putting himself into the ministry, or his fellow man
doing it, both of which are alike opposed to the mind of
God, and to all the principles of the true ministry as
taught in the word. If we are to be guided by Scripture,
we must see that all ministry in or out of the house
must be by divine appointment and divine ability. If it
be not thus, it is worse than worthless. A man may set
himself up as a minister, or he may be set up by his
fellows; but it is all utterly vain. It is not from heaven&mdash;it
is not of God&mdash;it is not by Jesus Christ; and, in the
sequel, it will be made manifest and judged as a most
horrible and daring usurpation.</p>

<p>It is of the very last importance that the Christian
reader should thoroughly seize this grand principle of
ministry. It is as simple as it is solemn. And, moreover,
that it rests on a basis truly divine cannot be questioned
by any one who bows down&mdash;as every Christian ought&mdash;with
unqualified and absolute submission, to the authority
of the divine word. Let the reader take his Bible, and
read carefully every line therein which bears upon the
subject of ministry. If he turns to the parable of the
house-steward, he will read, "Whom <i>his lord</i> hath made
ruler." He does not make himself ruler; neither is he
appointed by his fellows. The appointment is divine.</p>

<p>So, also, in the parable of the talents, the master calls
his own servants, and delivers unto them his goods. The
call and the equipment are divine.</p>

<p>We have another aspect of the same truth in Luke xix.
"A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive
for himself a kingdom, <i>and to return</i>. And he called his
ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said
unto them, Occupy <i>till I come</i>." The difference between
Luke and Matthew appears to be this: in the former,
human responsibility; in the latter, divine sovereignty is
prominent. But in both the great root-principle is distinctly
maintained and unanswerably established, namely,
that all ministry is by divine appointment.</p>

<p>The same truth meets us in the Acts of the Apostles.
When one was to be appointed to fill the place of Judas,
the appeal is made to Jehovah, "Thou, Lord, which
knowest the hearts of all, show whether of these two <i>thou
hast chosen</i>; that he may take part of this ministry and
apostleship."</p>

<p>And even where it is a question of local charge, as of
deacons, in chapter vi., or of elders, in chapter xiv., it is
by direct apostolic appointment. In other words, it is
divine. A man could not even appoint himself to a
deaconship, much less to an eldership. In the case of the
former, inasmuch as the deacons were to take charge of
the people's property, these latter were, in the grace and
lovely moral order of the Spirit, permitted to select men
in whom they could confide; but the appointment was
divine, whether of deacons or elders. Thus, whether it
be a question of gift or of local charge, all rests on a
purely divine basis. This is <i>the</i> all-important point.</p>

<p>Again, if we turn to the Epistles, the same great truth
shines in full and undimmed lustre before us. Thus, at
the opening of Romans xii., we read, "For I say, through
the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you,
not to think of himself more highly than he ought to
think; but to think soberly, according as <i>God hath dealt
to every man the measure of faith</i>. For as we have many
members in one body, and all members have not the
same office; so we being many, are one body in Christ,
and every one members one of another. Having then
<i>gifts</i> differing <i>according to the grace that is given us</i>," etc.
In 1 Cor. xii. we read, "<i>But now hath God set the members
every one of them in the body</i> as it hath pleased him"
(verse 18). And again, "<i>God hath set some in the church</i>,
first, apostles," etc. (verse 28). So also in Ephesians iv.,
"But unto every one of us is given grace according to
the measure of <i>the gift of Christ</i>."</p>

<p>All these Scriptures, and many more that might be
quoted, go to establish the truth which we are intensely
anxious to impress upon our readers, namely, that ministry
in all its departments, is divine&mdash;is of God&mdash;is from
heaven&mdash;is by Jesus Christ. There is positively no such
thing in the New Testament as human authority to minister
in the church of God. Turn where we may,
throughout its sacred pages, and we find only the same
blessed doctrine as is contained in that one brief sentence
in our parable, "He called his own servants, and delivered
unto them his goods." The whole New Testament doctrine
of ministry is embodied here; and we earnestly entreat
the Christian reader to let this doctrine take full
possession of his soul, and exert its full sway over his
conduct, course and character.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>But it may perhaps be asked, "Is there no adaptation
of the vessel to the ministerial gift deposited therein?"
Unquestionably there is; and this very adaptation is distinctly
presented in the words of our parable, "Unto one
he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one;
to every man <i>according to his several ability</i>."</p>

<p>This is a point of deepest interest, and it must never
be lost sight of. The Lord knows what use He means to
make of a man. He knows the character of gift which
He purposes to deposit in the vessel, and He shapes the
vessel and moulds the man accordingly. We cannot
doubt that Paul was a vessel specially formed of God for
the place he was afterwards to fill, and the work he had
to do. And so in every case. If God designs a man to
be a public speaker, He gives him lungs, He gives him a
voice, He gives him a physical constitution adapted to
the work which He designs him to do. The gift is
from God; but there is always the most distinct reference
to the ability of the man.</p>

<p>If this be lost sight of, our apprehension of the true
character of ministry will be very defective indeed. We
must never forget the two things, namely, the divine gift,
and the human vessel in which the gift is deposited.
There is the sovereignty of God, and the responsibility
of man. How perfect and how beautiful are all the ways
of God! But alas! alas! man mars everything, and the
touch of the human finger only dims the lustre of divine
workmanship. Still, let us never forget that ministry is
divine in its source, its nature, its power, and its object.
If the reader rises from this paper convinced in heart and
soul of this grand truth, we have so far gained our object
in penning it.</p>

<p>But it is not improbable the question may be asked,
"What has all this subject of ministry to do with the
Lord's coming?" Much every way. Does not our
blessed Lord introduce the subject again and again, in
His discourse on the mount of Olives? And is not this
entire discourse a reply to the question of the disciples,
"What shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of
the age?" Is not His coming the great prominent point
of the discourse as a whole, and of each section of it in
particular? Unquestionably.</p>

<p>And what, we may ask, is the next prominent theme?
Is it not ministry? Look at the parable of the servant
made ruler over the household. How is he to serve? In
view of his Lord's return. The ministry links itself on,
as it were, to the departing and the return of the Master.
It stands between, and is to be characterized by, these
two grand events. And what is it that leads to failure in
the ministry? Losing sight of the Lord's return. The
evil servant says in his heart, "My Lord delayeth His
coming," and, as a consequence, "he begins to smite his
fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken."</p>

<p>So also in the parable of the talents. The solemn and
soul-stirring word is "Occupy till I come." In short, we
learn that ministry, whether in the house of God or
abroad in the world, is to be carried on in full view of the
Lord's return. "After a long time the lord of those
servants cometh and reckoneth with them." All the
servants are to keep continually before their minds the
solemn fact that there is a reckoning time coming. This
will regulate their thoughts and feelings in reference to
every branch of their ministry. Hearken to the following
weighty words in which one servant seeks to animate
another, "I charge thee therefore before God, and the
Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the
dead at his appearing and his kingdom: preach the
word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine. For
the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves
teachers, having itching ears. And they shall turn
away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto
fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions,
do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of
my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. I
have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth
there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me <i>at that
day</i>; and not to me only, <i>but unto all them also that love
his appearing</i>" (2 Tim. iv. 1-8).</p>

<p>Does not this touching and weighty passage show how
intimately the subject of ministry stands connected with
the Lord's coming? The blessed apostle&mdash;the most devoted,
gifted, and effective workman that ever wrought
in the vineyard of Christ&mdash;the most skillful steward that
ever handled the mysteries of God&mdash;the wise master
builder&mdash;the great minister of the church and preacher
of the gospel&mdash;the incomparable servant&mdash;this rare and
precious vessel carried on his work, fulfilled his ministry,
and discharged his holy responsibilities in full view of
"<i>that day</i>." He looked forward, and is still looking, to
that solemn and glorious occasion when the Righteous
Judge shall place on his brow "the crown of righteousness."
And he adds, with such affecting sweetness, "not to
me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."</p>

<p>This is peculiarly touching. There will be a crown of
righteousness in "that day," not merely for the gifted,
laborious, and devoted Paul, but for every one that loves
the appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. No
doubt Paul shall have gems in his crown of peculiar lustre;
but, lest any one should think that the crown of
righteousness was only for Paul, he adds these lovely
words, "unto all them also that love his appearing."
The Lord be praised for such words! May they have the
effect of stirring up our hearts, not only to love the appearing
of our Lord, but also to serve with more intense
and whole-hearted devotedness in view of that glorious
day! That the two things are very closely connected we
may see in the sequel of the parable of the talents. We
can do little more than quote the words of our Lord.</p>

<p>When the servants had received the talents, we read,
"Then he that had received the five talents went and
traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
And likewise he that had received two, he also gained
other two. But he that had received one went and digged
in the earth and hid his lord's money. After a long
time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth
with them. And so he that had received five talents came
and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst
unto me five talents; behold I have gained besides
them five talents more. His lord said unto him, Well
done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful
over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. He also that
had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst
unto me two talents; behold, I have gained two
other talents beside them. His lord said unto him, Well
done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful
over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many
things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."</p>

<p>It is interesting and instructive to note the difference
between the parable of the talents as given in Matthew,
and the parable of the ten servants, in Luke xix. In the
former, it is a question of divine sovereignty; in the
latter, of human responsibility. In that, each receives a
like sum; in this, one receives five, another two, according
to the master's will. Then, when the day of reckoning
comes, we find in Luke a definite reward according to
the work; whereas in Matthew, the word is, "I will
make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the
joy of thy lord." They are not told what they are to
have, or how many things they are to rule over. The
master is sovereign both in His gifts and rewards; and
the crowning point of all is, "Enter thou into the joy of
thy lord."</p>

<p>This, to a heart that loves the Lord, is beyond everything.
True, there will be the ten cities and the five
cities. There will be ample, distinct, and definite reward
for responsibility discharged, service rendered, and work
done. All will be rewarded. But above and beyond all,
shines this precious word, "Enter thou into the joy of
thy lord." No reward can possibly come up to this.
The sense of the love that breathes in these words will
lead each one to cast his "crown of righteousness" at the
feet of his Lord. The very crown which the righteous
Judge shall give, we shall willingly cast at the feet of a
loving Saviour and Lord. One smile from Him will
touch the heart far more deeply and powerfully than the
brightest crown that could be placed on the brow.</p>

<p>But one word ere we close. Who would not work?
Who hid his lord's money? Who proved to be "a
wicked and slothful servant?" The man who did not
know his master's heart&mdash;his master's character&mdash;his
master's love. "Then he which had received the one
talent, came and said, Lord, I know thee, [?] that thou
art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and
gathering where thou hast not strewed; and I was afraid,
and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou
hast that is thine. His Lord answered and said unto him,
Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I
reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not
strewed. Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money
to the exchangers, and then at my coming, I should have
received mine own with usury. Take therefore the
talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten
talents. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and
he shall have abundance; but from him that hath not
shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast
ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</p>

<p>How awfully solemn! How striking the contrast between
the two servants! One knows, and loves, and
trusts, and serves his Lord. The other belies, fears, distrusts,
and does nothing. The one enters into the joy of
his lord, the other is cast out into outer darkness, into the
place of weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.
How solemn! How soul-subduing is all this! And when
does it all come out? When the Master returns!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;We may add, in connection with the foregoing remarks, on
ministry, that every Christian has his and her own specific place and
work to do. All are solemnly responsible to the Lord to know their
place and fill it, to know their work and do it. This is a plain practical
truth, and most fully confirmed by the principle upon which we have
been insisting, namely, that all ministry and all work must be received
from the Master's hand, carried on under His eye, and in full view of His
coming. These things must never be forgotten.</p></blockquote>

<h3>CONCLUDING REMARKS</h3>

<p>We must now draw this series of papers to a close; and
it is with a strong feeling of reluctance that we do so.
The theme is intensely interesting, deeply practical, and
abundantly fruitful. Moreover, it is very suggestive, and
opens up an extensive field of vision for the spiritual mind
to range through with an interest that never flags, because
the subject is inexhaustible.</p>

<p>However, we must, for the present at least, close our
meditations on this most marvellous line of truth; but
ere doing so, we are anxious to call the reader's attention,
as briefly as possible, to one or two things which have
been barely hinted at in the progress of these papers.
We should not think of recalling them were it not that
we deem them not only interesting, but of real practical
value in helping to a clearer understanding of many
branches of the great subject which has been engaging
our attention.</p>

<p>And first, then, the reader who has travelled in company
with us through the various branches of our subject
will remember a cursory reference to what we ventured to
call "an unnoticed interval&mdash;break&mdash;or parenthesis" in
the dealings of God with Israel and with the earth. This
is a point of the deepest interest; and we hope to be able
to show the reader that it is not some curious question, a
dark mysterious subject, or a favorite notion of some
special school of prophetic interpretation. Quite the
contrary. We consider it to be a point which throws a
flood of light on very many branches of our general subject.
Such we have found it for ourselves, and as such
we desire to present it to our readers. Indeed we strongly
question if any one can rightly understand prophecy
or his own true position and bearings, who does not see
the unnoticed interval or break above referred to.</p>

<p>But let us turn directly to the word, and open at chapter
ix. of the book of Daniel.</p>

<p>The opening verses of this remarkable section show us
the beloved servant of God in profound exercise of soul
in reference to the sad condition of his much loved people
Israel&mdash;a condition into which, through the Spirit of
Christ, he most thoroughly enters. Though not having
himself personally participated in these actings which
had brought ruin upon the nation, yet he identifies himself,
most completely, with the people, and makes their sins
his own in confession and self-judgment before his God.</p>

<p>We cannot attempt to quote from Daniel's remarkable
prayer and confession on this occasion; but the subject
which immediately concerns us now is introduced in
verse 20.</p>

<p>"And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing
my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting
my supplication before the Lord my God for the
holy mountain of my God; yea, while I was speaking
in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the
vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly,
touched me about the time of the evening oblation. And
he informed me and talked with me, and said. O Daniel,
I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.
At the beginning of thy supplications the commandments
came forth, and I am come to show thee; for thou art
greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and
consider the vision. Seventy weeks are determined [or
portioned out] upon thy people, and upon thy holy city,
to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,
and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy."</p>

<p>Now we cannot, in our limited space, enter upon any
elaborate argument to prove that the "seventy weeks,"
in the above quotation, mean really four hundred and
ninety years. We assume this to be the fact. We believe
that Gabriel was commissioned to instruct the beloved
prophet, and to inform him of the fact that, from
the going forth of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem, a
period of four hundred and ninety years was to elapse,
and that then Israel would be brought into blessing.</p>

<p>This is as simple and definite as anything can be. We
may assert, with all possible confidence, that it is not so
certain that the sun shall rise, at the appointed moment,
to-morrow morning, as that at the close of the period
above named by the angelic messenger, Daniel's people
shall be brought into blessing. It is as sure as the throne
of God. Nothing can hinder. Not all the powers of
earth and hell combined shall be allowed to stand in the
way of the full and perfect accomplishment of the word
of God by the mouth of Gabriel. When the last sand of
the four hundred and ninetieth year shall have run out of
the glass, Israel shall enter upon the possession of all
their destined pre-eminence and glory. It is impossible
to read Daniel ix. 24, and not see this.</p>

<p>But, it may be, the reader feels disposed to ask&mdash;and
ask, too, with astonishment, "Have not the four hundred
and ninety years expired long ago?" We reply, Certainly
not. Had they done so, Israel would be now in
their own land, under the blessed reign of their own
loved Messiah. Scripture cannot be broken; nor can
we play fast and loose with its statements, as though they
might mean anything or everything, or nothing at all.
The word is precise. "Seventy weeks are portioned out
upon thy people." Neither more nor less than seventy
weeks. If this be taken to mean literal weeks, the passage
has no sense or meaning whatever. It would be an
insult to our readers to occupy time in combating such
an absurdity as this.</p>

<p>But if, as we are most thoroughly persuaded, Gabriel
meant seventy weeks of years, then have we a period
most distinct and definite before us&mdash;a period extending
from the moment in which Cyrus issued his decree to restore
Jerusalem, to the moment of Israel's restoration.</p>

<p>Still, however, the reader may feel led to ask, "How
can these things be? It is very much more than four
hundred and ninety years, four times told, since the king
of Persia issued his decree, and yet there is no sign of
Israel's restoration. There must surely be some other
mode of interpreting the seventy weeks."</p>

<p>We can only repeat our statement, that the four hundred
and ninety years are not out yet. There has been a
break&mdash;a parenthesis&mdash;a long unnoticed interval. Let
the reader look closely at Daniel ix. 25, 26; "Know
therefore and understand, that from the going forth of
the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, unto
the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks [49 years]
and threescore and two weeks [434 years]; the street
shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous
times;" or, as the margin reads it, "in strait of times,"
that is, the street and the wall of Jerusalem were built in
the shorter of the two periods named, or in forty-nine
years. "And after threescore and two weeks [434 years
from the rebuilding of Jerusalem], shall Messiah be cut
off, and have nothing" (see margin).</p>

<p>Here then we reach the marked, memorable, and
solemn epoch. The Messiah, instead of being received,
is cut off. In place of ascending the throne of David, He
goes to the cross. Instead of entering upon the possession
of all the promises, He has nothing. His only portion&mdash;so
far as Israel and the earth were concerned&mdash;was
the cross, the vinegar, the spear, the borrowed grave.</p>

<p>Messiah was rejected, cut off, and had nothing. What
then? God signified His sense of this act, by suspending
for a time His dispensational dealings with Israel. The
course of time is interrupted. There is a great gap.
Four hundred and eighty-three years are fulfilled; seven
yet remain&mdash;a cancelled week, and all the time since the
death of the Messiah has been an unnoticed interval&mdash;a
break or parenthesis, during which Christ has been
hidden in the heavens, and the Holy Ghost has been
working on earth in forming the body of Christ, the
church, the heavenly bride. When the last member shall
have been incorporated into this body, the Lord Himself
shall come and receive His people to Himself, to conduct
them back to the Father's house, there to be with Him in
the ineffable communion of that blessed home, while God
will, by His governmental dealings, prepare Israel and
the earth for the introduction of the First-begotten into
the world.</p>

<p>Now as to this interval and all that was to occur therein,
Gabriel maintains a profound reserve. Whether he
understood aught of it is not the question. It is clear
he was not commissioned to speak of it, inasmuch as the
time was not come for so doing. He passes, with marvellous
and mysterious abruptness, over ages and generations&mdash;steps
from headland to headland of the prophetic
chart, and dismisses in a short sentence or two, a lengthened
period of nearly two thousand years. The siege of
Jerusalem by the Romans is thus briefly noticed, "The
people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the
city and the sanctuary." Then, a period which has already
lasted for eighteen centuries is thus disposed of,
"And the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto
the end of the war desolations are determined."</p>

<p>Then, with intense rapidity, we are conducted on to
the time of the end, when the last of the seventy weeks,
the last seven of the four hundred and ninety years, shall
be accomplished. "And he [the Prince] shall confirm
the covenant with many [of the Jews] <i>for one week</i>
[seven years]; and in the midst of the week he shall
cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the
overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate,
even until the consummation, and that determined shall
be poured upon the desolator" (margin).</p>

<p>Here then we reach the end of the four hundred and
ninety years which were determined or portioned out
upon Daniel's people. To attempt to interpret this period
without seeing the break and the long unnoticed interval,
must of necessity plunge the mind in utter confusion.
It cannot possibly be done. Numberless theories have
been started; endless calculations and speculations have
been attempted; but in vain. The four hundred and
ninety years are not accomplished yet; nor will they
have their accomplishment until the church has left this
scene altogether, and gone to be with her Lord in her
bright heavenly home. Revelation iv., v. show us the
place which the heavenly saints shall occupy during the
last of Daniel's seventy weeks; while from chapter vi.-xviii.
we have the various actings of God in government,
preparing Israel and the earth for the bringing in of the
first-begotten in the world.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>We are very anxious to make these matters clear to the
reader. It has greatly helped us in the understanding
of prophecy, and cleared away many difficulties. We
feel thoroughly persuaded that no one can understand
the book of Daniel, or indeed the general scope of prophecy,
who does not see that the last of the seventy weeks
remains to be fulfilled. Not one jot or tittle of God's
word can ever pass away, and seeing He has declared
that "seventy weeks were portioned out upon Daniel's
people," and that at the close of that period they should
be brought into blessing, it is plain that this period is not
yet expired. But unless we see the break, and the dropping
of time, consequent upon the rejection of the Messiah,
we cannot possibly make out the fulfilment of
Daniel's seventy weeks, or four hundred and ninety years.</p>

<p>Another important fact for the reader to seize is this,
the church forms no part of the ways of God with Israel
and the earth. The church does not belong to time, but
to eternity. She is not earthly, but heavenly. She is
called into existence during an unnoticed interval&mdash;a
break or parenthesis consequent upon the cutting off of
the Messiah. To speak after the manner of men, if Israel
had received the Messiah, then the seventy weeks or four
hundred and ninety years would have been fulfilled; but
Israel rejected her King, and God has retired to His place
until they acknowledge their iniquity. He has suspended
His public dealings with Israel and the earth,
though most surely controlling all things by His providence,
and keeping His eye upon the seed of Abraham,
ever beloved for the fathers' sake.</p>

<p>Meanwhile He is calling out from Jews and Gentiles
that body called the church, to be the companion of His
Son in heavenly glory&mdash;to be thoroughly identified with
Him in His present rejection from this earth, and to wait
in holy patience for His glorious advent.</p>

<p>All this marks off the Christian's position in the most
definite manner possible. His portion and his prospects,
too, are thus defined with equal clearness. It is vain to
look into the prophetic page in order to find the church's
position, her calling, or her hope. They are not there.
It is entirely out of place for the Christian to be occupied
with dates and historic events, as though he were in anywise
involved therein. No doubt, all these things have
their proper place and their value, and their interest, as
connected with God's dealings with Israel and with the
earth. But the Christian must never lose sight of the
fact that he belongs to heaven, that he is inseparably
linked with an earth-rejected, heaven-accepted Christ&mdash;that
his life is hid with Christ in God&mdash;that it is his holy
privilege to be looking out, daily and hourly, for the
coming of his Lord. There is nothing to hinder the
realization of that blissful hope at any moment. There is
but one thing that causes the delay, and that is, "the
long-suffering of our Lord, not willing that any should
perish, but that all should come to repentance"&mdash;precious
words these for a lost and guilty world! The salvation is
<i>ready</i> to be revealed; and God is <i>ready</i> to judge. There
is nothing now to wait for but the gathering in of the
last elect one, and then&mdash;oh! most blessed thought&mdash;our
own dear and loving Saviour will come and receive us to
Himself to be with Him where He is, and to go no more
out forever.</p>

<p>Then when the church has gone to be with her Lord in
the heavenly home, God will resume His public actings
with Israel. They will be brought into great tribulation,
during the week already referred to. But at the close of
that period of unexampled pressure and trial, their long-rejected
Messiah will appear for their relief and deliverance.
He will come forth as the rider on the white horse,
accompanied by the heavenly saints. He will execute
summary judgment upon His enemies, and take to Himself
His great power and reign. The kingdoms of this
world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His
Christ. Satan shall be bound for a thousand years; and
the whole universe shall repose beneath the blissful and
benignant rule of the Prince of peace.</p>

<p>Finally, at the close of the thousand years, Satan shall
be loosed, and permitted to make one more desperate
effort&mdash;an effort issuing in his eternal defeat and consignment
to the lake of fire, there to be tormented with the
beast and the false prophet throughout the everlasting
ages.</p>

<p>Then follows the resurrection and judgment of the
wicked dead, and their consignment to the lake that
burneth with fire and brimstone&mdash;tremendous and appalling
thought! No heart can conceive&mdash;no tongue can
tell&mdash;the horrors of that lake of fire.</p>

<p>But hardly is there a moment to dwell upon the dark
and awful picture, ere the unutterable glories of the new
heavens and the new earth burst upon the vision of the
soul; the holy city is seen descending from heaven,
and these seraphic sounds fall upon the ear, "Behold,
the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell
with them, and they shall be his people, and God
himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall
be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain; for the former things are
passed away. And he that sat upon the throne, said,
Behold I make all things new."</p>

<p>O beloved Christian reader, what scenes are before us!
What grand realities! What brilliant moral glories!
May we live in the light and power of these things!
May we cherish that blessed hope of seeing the One who
loved us and gave Himself for us&mdash;who would not enjoy
His glory alone, but endured the wrath of God in order
that He might link us with Himself, and share with us all
His love and glory for ever. Oh! to live for Christ and
wait for His appearing!</p>

<h2>A FEW THOUGHTS</h2>

<h4>ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING</h4>

<h2>PRE-MILLENNIAL DOCTRINE</h2>

<p class="center">AND</p>

<h3>WAITING FOR THE SON</h3>

<p class="center">Rev. i. 5-7</p>


<p>In a day like the present, when knowledge on every
question is so widely diffused, it is most needful to press
upon the conscience of the Christian reader the vast distinction
between merely holding the <i>doctrine</i> of the
Lord's second coming and actually waiting for His appearing
(1 Thess. i. 10). Many, alas! hold and, it may
be, eloquently preach, the doctrine of a second advent
who really do not know <i>the Person</i> whose advent they
profess to believe and preach. This evil must be faithfully
pointed out and dealt with. The present is an age
of knowledge&mdash;of religious knowledge; but oh! my
reader, knowledge is not life, knowledge is not power&mdash;knowledge
will not deliver from sin, or Satan, from the
world, from death, from hell. Knowledge, I mean, short
of the knowledge of God in Christ. One may know a
great deal of Scripture, a great deal of prophecy, a great
deal of doctrine, and, all the while, be dead in trespasses
and sins.</p>

<p>There is, however, one kind of knowledge which necessarily
involves eternal life, and that is the knowledge of
God, as He is revealed in the face of Jesus Christ.
"This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" (John xvii. 3).
Now, it is impossible to be living in the daily and hourly
expectation of "the coming of the Son of Man," if the
Son of Man be not experimentally known. I may take
up the prophetic record, and by mere study, and the
exercise of my intellectual faculties, discover the doctrine
of the Lord's second coming, and yet be totally ignorant
of Christ, and living a life of entire alienation of heart
from Him. How often has this been the case! How
many have astonished us with their vast fund of prophetic
knowledge&mdash;a fund acquired, it may be, by years
of laborious research, and yet, in the end, proved themselves
to have been displaying unhallowed light&mdash;light
not acquired by prayerful waiting upon God!
Surely the thought of this should deeply affect our hearts
and solemnize our minds, and lead us to inquire whether
or not we know the blessed Person who, again and again,
announces Himself as about to "come quickly;" else,
if we know Him not, we may find ourselves of the number
of those addressed by the prophet in the following
startling words:&mdash;"Woe unto you that desire the day of
the Lord! to what end is it for you? The day of the
Lord is darkness, and not light. As if a man did flee
from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house,
and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit him.
Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness and not light?
even very dark and no brightness in it?" (Amos v.
18-20).</p>

<p>The second chapter of Matthew furnishes us with a
very striking illustration of the difference between mere
prophetic knowledge and the knowledge of Christ&mdash;between
the exercise of the intellect on the letter of Scripture,
and the drawings of the Father to the Person of
Christ. The wise men, manifestly led by the finger
of God, were in true and earnest search of Christ, and
they found Him. As to Scriptural knowledge, they
could not, for a moment, have competed with the chief
priests and scribes; yet what did the Scriptural knowledge
of the latter do for them? Why, it rendered
them efficient instruments for Herod, who called them
together for the purpose of making use of their Biblical
knowledge in his deadly opposition to God's Anointed.
They were able to give him chapter and verse, as we say.
But, my reader, while they were assisting Herod by their
knowledge, the wise men were, by the drawings of the
Father, making their way to Jesus. Blessed contrast!
How much happier to be a worshipper at the feet of
Jesus, though with slender knowledge, than to be a
learned scribe, with a heart cold, dead, and distant from
that blessed One! How much better to have the heart
full of lively affection for Christ than to have the intellect
stored with the most accurate knowledge of the letter of
Scripture! What is the melancholy characteristic of the
present time? A wide diffusion of Scriptural knowledge
with little love for Christ, and little devotedness to His
work; abundant readiness to quote Scripture, like the
scribes and chief priests, but little purpose of heart, like
the wise men, to open the treasures and present to Christ
the willing offerings of a heart filled by the sense of what
He is. What we want is personal devotedness, and not
the mere empty display of knowledge. It is not that
we would undervalue Scriptural knowledge; God forbid,
if that knowledge be found in connection with genuine
discipleship. But if it be not, I ask, of what value is it?
None whatever. The most extensive range of knowledge,
if Christ be not its centre, will avail just nothing; yea,
it will, in all probability, render us more efficient instruments
in Satan's hand for the furthering of his purposes
of hostility to Christ. An ignorant man can do but
little mischief; but a learned man, without Christ, can
do a great deal.</p>

<p>The verses which stand at the head of this paper present
to us the divine basis on which to found all Scriptural
knowledge, more especially prophetic knowledge.
Before any one can utter his hearty amen to the announcement,
"Behold he cometh with clouds," he must,
without any question, be able to join in the blessed burst
of praise, "To him that loved us, and washed us from
our sins in his own blood." The believer knows the
One who is coming, because He has loved him, and
washed him from his sins. The believer expects the
everlasting Lover of his soul. The meek and lowly One
who served, suffered, and was emptied down here, will
speedily come in the clouds of heaven, with power and
great glory, and <i>all</i> who know Him will welcome Him
with glad hosannahs&mdash;they will be able to say, "This is
the Lord, <i>we have waited for</i> him, we will rejoice and be
glad in his salvation." But, alas! there are, it is to be
feared, very many who hold and argue about the Lord's
coming who are not waiting for Him at all, who are living
for themselves in the world, and "mind earthly things."
How terrible to be found talking about the Lord's coming,
and yet, when He does come, <i>to be left behind</i>! Oh!
my beloved reader, think of this; and if you are really
conscious that you know not the Lord, then let me entreat
of you to behold Him shedding His precious blood
to wash you from your sins, and learn to confide in Him,
to lean upon Him, to rejoice in Him, and IN HIM
ALONE.</p>

<p>But if you can look up to heaven, and say, "Thank
God, I do know Him, and I am waiting for Him," then
let me remind you of what the apostle John says, as to
the practical result of this blessed hope. "Every man
that hath this hope <i>in him</i>, purifieth himself, even as <i>he</i>
is pure." Yes, this must ever be the result of waiting
for the Son from heaven; but not at all so of the mere
prophetic doctrine. Many of the most impure, profane
and ungodly characters, that have made their appearance
in the world, have held, in theory, the second advent of
Christ; but they were not <i>waiting for the Son</i>, and therefore
they did not, and could not purify themselves. It
is impossible that any one can be waiting for Christ's appearing,
and not make efforts after increased holiness,
separation, and devotedness of heart: "Behold, I come
quickly; blessed is he that watcheth." Those who know
the Lord Jesus Christ, and love His appearing, will daily
seek to shake off everything contrary to their Master's
mind; they will seek to become more and more conformed
to Him in all things. Men may hold the doctrine
of the Lord's coming, and yet grasp the world and
the things thereof with great eagerness; but the true-hearted
servant will ever keep his eye steadily fixed on
his Master's return, remembering His blessed words, "I
will come again and receive you unto myself, that where
I am, there ye may be also" (John xiv. 3).</p>

Herod and Pilate, the chief priests and scribes, the Pharisees

<span class="smcap">the Father and the Son</span>, who, in company, ascend the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The reader will not, I trust, imagine that the necessity for the
work of the Holy Ghost in the regeneration of the children of
Christian parents is denied or interfered with. God forbid! "Except
a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
This is as true of a Christian's child as of every one else. Grace is
not hereditary. The sum of what I would press upon Christian
parents is, that Scripture inseparably links a man with his house,
and that the Christian parent is warranted in counting upon God
for his children, and responsible to train his children for God. Let
any one who denies this interpret Ephesians vi. 4.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> It will be said that there cannot be any analogy between the
actual removal of people from one country to another and the
training of our children. I reply, the analogy only applies in principle.
It is perfectly evident that we cannot take our children to
heaven in the sense in which the Israelites took theirs to Canaan.
God alone can fit our children for heaven, by implanting in them
the life of His own Son; and He alone can bring them to heaven,
in His own time. But then, although we can neither fit our children
for, nor bring them to, heaven, we can, nevertheless, by faith,
train them for it; and it is not merely our <i>duty</i> (a poor, cold, and
unworthy expression), but our high and holy <i>privilege</i> so to do.
Hence, therefore, if the principle on which, and the object with
which, we train our children are manifestly worldly, we do, virtually,
and so far as in us lies, leave them in the world. And on the
other hand, if our principle and object are unequivocally heavenly,
then do we, so far as in us lies, train them for heaven. This, my
beloved reader, is all that is meant in this tract by leaving our
children in Egypt or taking them to Canaan. We are responsible
to <i>train</i> our children, though we cannot <i>convert</i> them; and God
will assuredly bless the faithful training of those whom He has
graciously given us.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> There is, I should say, a very serious error involved in a Christian
parent's committing the training of his children to unconverted
persons, or even to those whose hearts are not one with him as to
separation from the world. It is natural that a child should look
up to, and follow the example of, one who has the training and
management of him. Now, what can a teacher make of a child,
save what he is himself? Whither can he lead him, but to where
he is himself? What principles can he instill, save those which
govern his own mind, and form the basis of his own character?
Well, if I see a man governed by worldly principles&mdash;if I see plainly,
from his whole course and character, that he is an unconverted
person, shall I commit to him the training and instruction of my
children, or the formation of their characters? It would be the
height of folly and inconsistency so to do. As well might a man
who desired to make an oval-shaped bullet cast the melted lead
into a circular mould.
</p><p>
The same principle applies to the reading of books. A book is decidedly
a <i>silent</i> teacher and former of the mind and character; and
if I am called to look well to the character and principles of the
living teacher, I am equally so to look to those of the silent teacher.
I am quite convinced that in reference both to books and teachers,
we need to have our consciences stirred and instructed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Very many content themselves with the assurance that at some
time or other their children will be converted. But this is not taking
God's ground with them now. If we have the assurance that
they are within the range of God's purpose, why do we not act upon
that assurance? If we are waiting to see certain evidences of conversion
in them before we act as Scripture directs, it is plain that
we are looking at something besides God's promise. This is not
faith. The Christian parent is privileged to look upon his child
now as one to be trained for the Lord. He is bound to take this
ground, in faith, and train him thus, looking to God, in the fullest
assurance, for the result. If I wait to see fruits, this is not faith.
Besides, the question arises, What are my children now? They
may be going about like idle, willful vagrants, bringing sad dishonor
on the name and truth of Christ, and yet all the while I
satisfy myself by saying, I know they will be converted yet. This
will never do. My children should be now a testimony for God;
and they can only be this by my taking God's ground with them,
and going on with Him about them.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The Christian parent may ask, What am I to teach my child?
The answer is simple. Teach him only such things as will prove
useful to him as a servant of Christ. Do not teach him aught which
you know would prove a positive source of defilement or weakness
to him should he remain here. We are seldom at a loss to know
what kind of food to give our children. We are tolerably well
aware of what would prove nourishing and what would prove the
reverse. Now, were the instincts of the new nature as true and as
energetic in us as those of the old, we should, I am persuaded, be
at as little loss to decide in reference to what we should teach our
children. In this, as in every thing else, it may be said, "If thine
eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light." If we have a
deep sense of Christ's glory, and a sincere desire to promote it, we
shall not be left in perplexity; but if our body is not "full of light,"
we may be assured our "eye" is not "single."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> I would, however, desire to remind the children of Christian
parents that they are solemnly responsible to hearken to God's holy
word, quite irrespective of the conduct of their parents. God's
truth is not affected by the actings of men; and wherever one has
heard the testimony of God's love, in the death and resurrection of
Christ, he is responsible for the use he makes thereof, even though
he should not have seen its sacred influence and power exemplified
in the life of his parents. I would press these facts upon the
serious attention of all children of Christian parents.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> "And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." (Eph. vi. 4.)
There is great danger of provoking our children to wrath by inordinate
strictness and arbitrary treatment. We may constantly
find ourselves seeking to mould and fashion our children according
to our own tastes and peculiarities, rather than to "bring them
up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." This is a very great
mistake, and will surely issue in failure and confusion. We shall
gain nothing, in the way of testimony for Christ, by moulding and
fashioning nature into the most exquisite shapes. Moreover, it
does not require faith to train and cultivate nature; but it does require
it to bring up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
</p><p>
Some, however, may say that the apostle, in the above passage,
is speaking of converted children. To this I reply, that there is
nothing about conversion in the passage. It is not said, Bring
up your converted children, etc. Were it thus, it would settle
the whole question. But it is simply said, "<i>your children</i>," which
surely must mean <i>all</i> our children. Now, if I am to bring up all
my children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, when am
I to commence? Am I to wait till they grow up to be almost men
and women? or am I to begin where all right minded people begin
their work, namely, at the <i>beginning</i>? Am I to allow them to run on
in nature's folly and wildness, during the most important part of
their career, without ever seeking to bring their consciences into
the presence of God, as to their solemn responsibilities? Am I to
suffer them to spend in utter thoughtlessness that period of life in
which the elements of their future character are imparted? This
would be the most refined cruelty. What should we say to a
gardener who would allow the branches of his fruit-trees to assume
all sorts of crooked and fantastic shapes ere he thought of commencing
a proper system of training? We should doubtless pronounce
him a fool and a madman. And yet such an one is wise in
comparison with a parent who suspends the nurture and admonition
of the Lord until his children have made manifest progress in
the nurture and admonition of the enemy.
</p><p>
But, it may be said, we must wait for evidences of conversion.
To this I reply, that faith never waits for evidences, but acts on
God's word, and the evidences are sure to follow. It is always a
manifest proof of infidelity to wait for signs when God gives a
command. If Israel had waited for a sign when God said, "Go
forward," it would have been plain disobedience; and if the man
with the withered hand had waited for some evidence of strength
when Christ commanded him to stretch forth his hand, he might
have carried his withered hand to the grave with him. So is it with
parents. If they wait for signs and evidences before they obey
God's word in Ephesians vi. 4, they are certainly not walking by
faith, but by sight. Besides, if we are to begin at the beginning to
train our children, we must evidently begin before they are capable
of giving what we might regard as evidences of conversion.
</p><p>
In this, as in every thing else, our place is to obey, and leave
results with God. The moral condition of the soul may be tested
by the command; but where there is the disposition to obey, the
power to do so will surely accompany the command, and the fruits
of obedience will follow "<i>in due season, if we faint not</i>."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> It was nature in Barnabas that led him to wish for the company
of one who "departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not
with them to the work." It was amiable nature, yet it was nature,
and it triumphed, for he took Mark and sailed to Cyprus, his native
country, where, in the freshness of his Christian course, he had sold
his property, in order to be a more unshackled follower of Him
who had not where to lay His head. (See Acts iv. 36, 37.) This is
no uncommon case. Many set out with a surrender of earth and
nature with their respective claims. The blossom on the tree of
Christian profession looks fair, and emits a fragrant perfume; but
alas! it is not followed by the rich and mellow fruit of autumn. The
influences of earth and nature gather around the soul, and nip its
beauteous blossoms, and all ends in barrenness and disappointment.
This is very sad, and is always attended with the very worst moral
effect upon the testimony. It is not at all a question of ceasing to
be a saved person. Barnabas was a saved person. The influences
of Mark and Cyprus could not blot out his name from the Lamb's
book of life, but they did most thoroughly blot out his name from
the records of testimony and service here below. And was not
this something to be lamented? Is there naught to be deplored or
dreaded save the loss of personal salvation? Most despicable is
the selfishness that can think so. For what purpose does the
blessed God take so much pains and trouble in maintaining His
people here? Is it that they may be saved and made meet for
glory? No such thing. Saved they are already, by the accomplished
redemption of Christ, and therefore meet for glory. There is no
middle step between justification and glory, for "whom He justified,
them He also glorified." Why, therefore, does God leave us here?
That we may be a testimony for Christ. Were it not for this, we
might just as well be taken to heaven the moment of our conversion.
May we have grace to understand this point, in all its fullness and
practical power.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The epistles of Peter develop the doctrine of God's moral
government. He it is who asks the question, "Who is he that will
harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?" Now, some
may find a difficulty in reconciling this inquiry with Paul's statement,
"All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
It were needless to say that the two ideas are in perfect
and beautiful harmony. The Lord Jesus Himself, who was the
only perfect and unwavering follower of that which is good, who,
from first to last, "went about doing good," found, in the end, the
cross, the spear, the borrowed grave. The apostle Paul, who,
beyond all other men, kept close to the Great Original which was
set before him, was called to drink an unusually large cup of privation
and persecution. And to this moment, the more like Christ,
and the more devoted to Him any one is, the more privation and
persecution he will suffer. Were any one, in true devotedness to
Christ and love to souls, to take his stand publicly in some Roman
Catholic district, and there preach Christ, his life would be in
imminent danger. Do all these facts interfere with Peter's inquiry?
By no means. The direct tendency of God's moral government is
to protect from injury all who are "followers of that which is
good," and to bring down punishment upon all who are the reverse;
but it never interferes with the higher path of ardent discipleship,
or deprives any one of the privilege and dignity of being as like
Christ as he will; "for unto you <i>it is given</i>, on behalf of Christ
[&#964;&#959; &#965;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#965;],
not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer
for Him [&#965;&#960;&#949;&#961; &#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#965;]; having the same conflict which ye saw in
me, and now hear in me." (Phil. i. 29, 30.) Here we are taught that
it is an actual gift conferred upon us to be allowed to suffer for
Christ, and this in the midst of a scene in which, on the ground of
God's moral government, it can be said, "Who is he that will harm
you, if ye be followers of that which is good?" To recognize and
be a subject of God's government is one thing, and to be a follower
of a rejected and crucified Christ is quite another. Even in Peter's
epistle, which, as we have remarked, has as its special theme the
doctrine of God's government, we read, "But if, doing well and
suffering for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable to God. For
unto this were ye called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving
us an example, that we should follow His steps." And again, "If any
suffer <i>as a Christian</i> [from being morally like Christ], let him not
be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter."]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Nothing can be more melancholy than to hear a mother say to
a child, "We must not let your father know any thing about this."
Where such a course of reserve and double dealing is adopted,
there must be something radically and awfully wrong, and it is a
moral impossibility that any thing like godly order can prevail, or
right discipline be carried out. Either the father must, by inordinate
severity or unwarrantable strictness, be "provoking his children
to wrath," or the mother must be pampering the child's will at the
expense of the father's character and authority. In either case,
there is an effectual barrier to the testimony, and the children suffer
grievous injury. Hence, Christian parents should see well to it
that they always appear before their children, and also before their
servants, in the power of that unity which flows from their being
perfectly joined together in the Lord. If, unhappily, any shade of
difference should arise in reference to the details of domestic
government, let it be made a matter of private conference, prayer,
and self-judgment in the presence of God; but never let the subjects
of government see such a manifest proof of moral weakness,
for it will surely cause them to despise the government.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> There are many cases in which one finds persons united, who
though they cannot exactly be said to be "unequally yoked," are,
to say the least, very badly matched. Their tempers, tastes, habits,
and views are totally different; and so different, that instead of
maintaining a desirable balance (which opposite tempers, if properly
arranged, might do), they keep up a perpetual jar, to the sad
derangement of the domestic circle, and the dishonor of the Lord's
name. All this might be very much obviated if Christians would
only wait upon God, and make His glory more their object than
personal interest or affection.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> It is important for the Christian to bear in mind the words of
our Lord Jesus Christ, "If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall
be full of light." Whenever I am in perplexity as to my path, I
have reason to suspect that my eye is not single; for, assuredly,
perplexity is not compatible with a "body full of light." We frequently
go to pray for guidance in matters with which, if the eye
were single and the will subject, we would have nothing whatever
to do, and hence we should have no need to pray about them. To
pray about aught concerning which the Word of God is plain, marks
the activity of a rebellions will. As a recent writer has well remarked,
"We sometimes seek God's will, desiring to know how to
act in circumstances <i>in which it is not His will that we should be
found at all</i>; if conscience were in real healthful activity, its first
effect would be to make us quit them. It is our own will which sets
us there, and we should like, nevertheless, to enjoy the consolation
of God's direction in a path which ourselves have chosen. Such is a
very common case. Be assured that if we are near enough to God,
we shall have no trouble to know His will.... However, 'if
thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light;' whence
it is certain that if the whole body is not full of light, the eye is not
single. You will say, That is poor consolation. I answer, It is a
rich consolation for those whose sole desire is to have the eye single
and <i>to walk with God</i>."</p></div>

does not mean, as some suppose, those only who hold the truth of the
Lord's second coming. This would make our place with Christ at His
coming dependent upon knowledge, instead of upon our union with Him
by the presence and power of the Holy Ghost. The Spirit of God, in the
above passage, most graciously takes for granted that all God's people
are looking, in some way or another, for the precious Saviour; and verily
so they are. They may not see eye to eye as to all the details. They
may not all enjoy equal clearness of view or depth and fulness of apprehension;
but, most surely, they would all be glad at any moment to see
the One who loved them and gave Himself for them.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> We shall have occasion, in a future paper, to show that, after the
church has been removed to heaven, the Spirit of God will act both
among the Jews, and also among the Gentiles. See Revelation vii.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> We have no pretensions whatever to scholarship; we are merely
gleaners in the deeply interesting field of criticism in which others have
reaped a golden harvest. We do not mean to occupy our readers with
arguments in defence of readings given in the text; but we feel that
there is no use in giving them what we consider to be erroneous. We believe
there is no doubt whatever that the true reading of 2 Thessalonians
ii. is as we have given it above, "as that the day of the Lord is present."
The word &#949;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957; can only be thus rendered. It occurs in Romans
viii. 38, where it is translated "things <i>present</i>." So also in 1 Corinthians
iii. 22, "things <i>present</i>;" chapter vii. 25, "<i>present</i> distress;" Galatians
i. 4, "<i>present</i> evil world;" Hebrews ix. 9, "time then <i>present</i>."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Some have considered that the hinderer or hindrance was the Roman
empire; others that it is the Holy Ghost in the church. To this latter
we have inclined for many years, though it may be there is a measure of
truth in the former. This, at least, we know from other parts of Scripture,
that ere the lawless one appears on the scene, the church will have
been safely and blessedly housed in her own eternal home above&mdash;her
prepared place. How precious the thought of this!</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> The English reader should be informed that, in the entire passage,
John v. 22-26, the words "judgment," "condemnation," "damnation,"
are all expressed by the same word in the original, and that word is
simply "judgment," &#954;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962;, the process, not the result. It is much to
be deplored that our Authorized Version should not have so rendered the
word throughout. It would have made the teaching of the passage so
very much clearer. It is with extreme reluctance that we ever venture
to touch our unrivalled English Bible, but it is, at times, absolutely necessary
for the truth's sake, and for the sake of our readers. As to the
rendering of verse 24, it really comes to the same thing whether we say
"condemnation" or "judgment," inasmuch as if there be judgment at
all, its issue must be condemnation. But why not be accurate?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Contrast with this reluctant departure His ready entrance into the
tabernacle in Exodus xl.; and into the temple, 2 Chron. vii. 1. No
sooner was the habitation ready for Him, than down He came to occupy
it, and fill it with His glory He was as quick to enter as He was slow to
depart. And not only so, but ere the book of Ezekiel closes, we see the
glory coming back again; and "Jehovah Shammah" stands engraved
in everlasting characters upon the gates of the beloved city. Nothing
changeth God's affection. Whom He loves, and as He loves, He loves to
the end. "The same yesterday, to-day, and forever."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> We do not, by any means, restrict the application of the "talents"
to direct, specific, spiritual gifts. We believe the parable takes in the
wide range of Christian <i>service</i>: just as the parable of the ten virgins
takes in the wide range of Christian <i>profession</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> It is, we are aware, a question among the expositors, whether the
events detailed in Revelation vi.-xviii. will occupy a whole week or only
a half. We do not here attempt to offer an opinion. Some consider that
the public ministry of John the Baptist and that of our Lord occupied a
week, or seven years, and that in consequence of Israel's rejection of both,
the week is cancelled, and remains yet to be fulfilled. It is an interesting
question; but it in no wise affects the great principles which have
been before us, or the interpretation of the book of Revelation. We
may add that the expressions "forty and two months"&mdash;"twelve hundred
and sixty days"&mdash;"time, times, and the dividing of time" indicate
the period of half a week, or three years and a half.</p></div>
